    "html": "<p>As part of the site redesign, there is a new section (which you are reading right now), &quot;Product and site news&quot;. This section (together with the <a href=\"/a/knowledge-base/\">Knowledge base</a> section) takes over from the weblog at <a href=\"http://wincent.org/\">wincent.org</a>, which has existed in one form or another since 1997. To make it easy to find the new section, requests for <a href=\"http://wincent.org/\">wincent.org</a> will be automatically redirected here. You can continue to access the archives of material posted on the old weblog by directing your browser to <a href=\"http://wincent.org/article/frontpage/1\">http://wincent.org/article/frontpage/1</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>History</h2>\n\n<p>The site now known as &quot;<a href=\"http://wincent.org\">wincent.org</a>&quot; began its life on the web in 1997 as &quot;Wincent&apos;s Website&quot;, although it did not move to its own domain name until a couple of years later. On moving to the dot-org domain, it switched to a weblog format.</p>\n\n<p>In 2002 with the release of <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">Synergy</a>, the nature of the site changed. It now had to serve not only as an informational weblog, but as a product website as well.</p>\n\n<p>In 2003 I acquired the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/\">wincent.com</a> domain name and tried to establish a separation between the commercial content (products) which would be hosted on <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/\">wincent.com</a>, and the non-commercial content (articles, tips, information) which would continued to be hosted on <a href=\"http://wincent.org/\">wincent.org</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But as I&apos;ve added more and more <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/\">products</a> to the lineup, the separation between the dot-com and the dot-org domains hasn&apos;t been all that clear. To add to the confusion, additional subdomains have sometimes made it hard to locate information. For example, users who search for information at <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">synergy.wincent.com</a> may not realize that there are useful resources on the parent site (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/\">wincent.com</a>), forums (<a href=\"http://forums.wincent.com/\">forums.wincent.com</a>), a bug-tracking and feature request database (<a href=\"http://bugs.wincent.com/\">bugs.wincent.com</a>), and the weblog (<a href=\"http://wincent.org/\">wincent.org</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The site redesign is largely directed at clearing up all this confusion and unifying <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/\">wincent.com</a> and <a href=\"http://wincent.org/\">wincent.org</a> into one easy to navigate website.</p>\n\n<p>People who have been visiting <a href=\"http://wincent.org/\">wincent.org</a> for years will be able to continue typing &quot;wincent.org&quot; into their browser&apos;s location bar and will arrive here. But new visitors coming here for the first time will be able to get here by clicking on the &quot;News&quot; link that appears in the navigation bar at the top of every page. The navigation bar is now consistent across the entire site, including all the product websites. Although the subdomains continue to exist, they now redirect to addresses in the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/\">wincent.com</a> hierarchy. For example, <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">synergy.wincent.com</a> now redirects to <a href=\"/a/products/synergy/\">http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy/</a>. And as you&apos;ll see, the navigation bar know includes &quot;bread crumb&quot; links that enable you to easily navigate upwards in the directory hierarchy.</p>\n\n<p>I hope that these changes make the site more useful for everybody.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000005more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

And the second issue has had me wasting countless mouse-clicks dismissing warning sheets in Safari thanks to my flakey Internet connection.

    "html": "<p>I&apos;m very pleased to present the brand new site layout for <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/\">wincent.com</a>, <a href=\"http://wincent.org/\">wincent.org</a> and all their subdomains. There have been minor tweaks to the appearance of the site, but the shining star of the new layout is the new navigation bar that appears at the top of each and every page. You can now skip to any section of the site -- <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/\">Products</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/services/\">Services</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/\">Support</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/\">About</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/\">News</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/knowledge-base/\">Knowledge Base</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/contact/\">Contact</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/site-map/\">Site Map</a> -- with a single click, and the &quot;bread crumb&quot; display shows you at a glance exactly where you are in the site hierarchy.</p>\n\n<p>To reduce confusion, the different product websites (<a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">synergy.wincent.com</a>, <a href=\"http://winswitch.wincent.com/\">winswitch.wincent.com</a>, <a href=\"http://winhex.wincent.com/\">winhex.wincent.com</a>, <a href=\"http://install.wincent.com/\">install.wincent.com</a>) and the forums (<a href=\"http://forums.wincent.com/\">forums.wincent.com</a>) have all been moved to logical places within the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/\">wincent.com</a> hierarchy. Likewise, the weblog that was previously hosted at <a href=\"http://wincent.org/\">wincent.org</a> has been rolled into the main <a href=\"http://wincent.com\">wincent.com</a> site, at <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/\">wincent.com/a/news/</a>. You can still point your browsers at the old subdomains if you wish, and you&apos;ll be redirected to the new locations. The main benefit is that people can move around the different sections much more easily; in the past visitors may not even have known that those other sections existed!</p>\n\n<p>My favorite part of the new navigation bar, however, is the set of pop-up menus that you&apos;ll see when you move the mouse pointer over the navigation bar buttons. These hierarchical menus allow you to navigate not only to the top-level sections on the site, but to sub-sections and pages several levels down with a single click. There&apos;s not a single line of JavaScript behind these menus; it&apos;s all done with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), so they&apos;ll display correctly in just about every modern browser. This really is a dream come true for me... The day has at last arrived where it&apos;s possible to use CSS for complex layout and dynamic elements and actually have it work on most users&apos; browsers!</p>\n\n<p>The following browsers have been tested with the new layout (all running on Mac OS X 10.3.6):</p>\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/safari/\">Apple Safari 1.2.4 (v125.11)</a>: correct display.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/\">Mozilla Firefox 1.0 RC2, 1.0</a>: correct display.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/\">Mozilla 1.7.3</a>: correct display.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/products/camino/\">Camino 0.8.1</a>: correct display.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/\">OmniWeb 5.0.1</a>: correct display.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.opera.com/\">Opera 7.54</a>: correct display.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://channels.netscape.com/ns/browsers/download.jsp\">Netscape 7.2</a>: correct display.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/internetexplorer/internetexplorer.aspx?pid=internetexplorer\">Internet Explorer 5.2.3 (5815.1)</a>: popup menus do not appear, but page layout is correct and the row of buttons in the navigation bar works.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.icab.de/\">iCab 2.9.8</a>: page layout completely broken, but site is navegable.</li></ul>\n\n<p>I am hoping that this will be a win-win situation for site visitors and for me. Although it has been a big task perfecting the new layout and moving all the material from the old sites into position, the administration burden in the future should be greatly reduced. Most of the dynamic elements are either stored on the server as <a href=\"http://www.php.net/\">PHP</a> includes (so that a single file can be edited and every page on the site will immediately reflect any changes), or built using <a href=\"http://movabletype.org/\">Movable Type</a> (where I can post content from my desktop using <a href=\"http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/\">ecto</a>; no need to fire up a browser or a behemoth like <a href=\"http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/\">Dreamweaver MX 2004</a>). Site appearance is largely controlled through a single, site-wide style sheet (once again, editing one file can change the appearance of the entire site). And apart from the maintenance improvements, if people can find their way around more easily and access support services like the <a href=\"http://forums.wincent.com/\">forums</a>, the <a href=\"http://bugs.wincent.com/\">bug-tracking and feature requests database</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/registration/\">lost license code retrieval system</a>, then I&apos;ll be able to spend more time working on new products.</p>\n\n<p>If you&apos;ve got any feedback on the new layout, please <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/contact/\">get in touch with me</a>.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000015more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

If you watch the keynote and skip forward about one hour and three minutes you&apos;ll see a sickeningly buzz-word-filled demonstration of transparent windows with movies playing in a window behind them, and watch in awe as windows shrink in slow motion when you minimize them (curiously like Mac OS X&apos;s &quot;genie&quot; effect).

    "html": "<p>Apologies to any who had trouble accessing the server earlier this evening. The file-system filled up due to a rogue process (or processes) run by another user on the system. The server continued to operate throughout the incident, but you may have had trouble connecting to the server during the period. I don&apos;t know if any mail got bounced but if it did I imagine it will be automatically redelivered. For the curious, you can read on for the full story of what happened.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000064more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>I noticed a few hours ago that I couldn&apos;t send outgoing email. Thinking it was just a transitory network failure between here (Spain) and the server (in Australia) I didn&apos;t worry about it. A few hours later I noticed that it still wasn&apos;t working and connected to the server to investigate.</p>\n\n<p>At that point I very quickly realized that the file system was full. This was quite alarming as it was only 50% full the day before and had been sitting at that level for some time. I run the server with an &quot;if it ain&apos;t broke don&apos;t fix it&quot; philosophy, which means that it gets security patches but other than that I keep it as static as possible. The last time I rebooted it for a security update it had been running continuously for well over 400 days. I don&apos;t change configuration files. I don&apos;t tinker. Stuff like this shouldn&apos;t happen.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing I tried to do was delete some files to give me some breathing room. That&apos;s when I started to get worried, because the file system was filing up as fast as I cleared space. For example, I would delete a directory containing a few hundred megabytes of temporary files, and by the time I typed &quot;df -h&quot; the system had completely filled up again!</p>\n\n<p>The operating system is smart enough that it never lets the file system get truly full. It maintains some space free so that the kernel can perform operations even when user processes cannot. So in this case I had about 2GB free of real space, but 0% &quot;available&quot;. Given that something was writing to the disk at a rate of a hundred or so meg per second I am very glad the kernel does that otherwise the server would have crashed like a stone, a fairly annoying outcome given that I am physically about as far away from the server as is possible to be.</p>\n\n<p>So there I was, thousands of miles away from my server, with no breathing room and a little nervous. The first thing I did was check the &quot;/var&quot; directory, looked for any runaway log files, looked at all my websites, and everything seemed to be in order. I then turned my attention to the other users on the server (for some years now I have donated hosting to a non-profit student organization of which I used to be a member).</p>\n\n<p>By using the &quot;du -d 1 -h&quot; command I was able to find where all the usage was occurring. Another user on the system (actually in a separate jail) was writing gigabytes of data to &quot;/var/mod_gzip/&quot; continuously. I stopped Apache for that jail, deleted the files and the problem was solved. I still don&apos;t know <em>why</em> this happened, but at least I know where and when. I won&apos;t be restarting Apache in that jail until I have a very good idea of what&apos;s going on. Needless to say, mod_gzip will not be enabled.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>I first registered the wincent.org domain back in September 1999 (prior to that I ran the website using the webspace and domain provided by my ISP). Back then <a href=\"http://netsol.com/\">Network Solutions</a> was the only registrar. From memory, I paid $35 for the privilege.</p>\n\n<p>Since then the market has opened up and competing registrars have been allowed in. These registrars generally undercut the Network Solutions price by a considerable margin. And people are starting to take notice: <a href=\"http://godaddy.com/\">GoDaddy</a> recently overtook Network Solutions as the number one registrar (as measured by the number of domains registered).</p>\n\n<p>Under the pressure of this competition, Network Solutions has lowered some -- but not all -- of its prices. Their base price for a dot-com domain is still an incredible $34.99. Incredible because the same domain can be had for $8.95 or less at GoDaddy (or countless other registrars).</p>\n\n<p>GoDaddy manages to make a profit even when it sells domains at or below their cost price because of the add-on services they offer. Even if only a small percentage of customers choose these extra services GoDaddy still comes out in front. Network solutions also offers add-on services but most of their profits come from their fat profit margins and their reliance on their historical monopoly; many people go to Network Solutions and pay their premium of over 400% simply because it&apos;s the oldest registrar.</p>\n\n<p>For a while I continued to register domains with Network Solutions because I wanted to keep all of my domains consolidated with a single registrar and because I didn&apos;t want to switch to a start-up with an unproven track record. By registering for multiple years I was able to obtain a discount that went some way towards bringing the Network Solutions price in line with the prices of the rest of the market.</p>\n\n<p>But things are changing; in fact, they&apos;ve already changed. The fact that GoDaddy is now the number one registrar indicates to me that the days in which one could justifiably register a domain with Network Solution are over. The consolidation argument still holds, but now I&apos;m consolidating all my domains (transferring them) to GoDaddy. GoDaddy is no longer the unproven start-up.</p>\n\n<p>The other day I called Network Solutions to get an authorization code to transfer my dot-org domains (including wincent.org) to GoDaddy.com. They asked me why I was transferring. I answered because of price and because of desire to consolidate. They then offered me a special price of $8.50 per year if I chose to keep the domains with Network Solutions. I&apos;m sorry, Netsol, but that&apos;s too little, too late. (And if you can sell domains for $8.50 per year, why are you asking $34.99 for them?)</p>\n\n<p>The current prices charged by GoDaddy ($7.95 per year for transferred domains) seem fair to me. My one remaining complaint with the domain name market is that private registrations are not free. With private registration you pay an extra fee to keep your personal contact details (name, address and phone number) away from prying eyes. Without private registration anybody on the Internet can do a whois lookup and find out those details. In my opinion, domain name registrations should be private by default (and privacy should not come at an extra charge); if you want your personal contact information made public then you should be able to opt out of the system.</p>\n\n<p>This is an unfortunate situation because privacy should be free. GoDaddy currently charges an additional fee of $8.95 per year for private registrations. That&apos;s more than the cost of the domain in the first place. I don&apos;t believe this service costs that much to provide. $2 per year might be fairer. Free would be better. In fact, I&apos;d rather be paying $9.95 per year for my domains and have private registration provided by default for that price.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000065more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>&quot;AEGizmos&quot; (or more often, simply &quot;AEGizmo&quot;) is the name for a set of APIs developed by Apple&apos;s Jens Peter Alfke between 1991 and 1995. He used to distribute the routines for free on his <a href=\"http://www.mooseyard.com/Jens/\">website</a> and they became fairly popular. Apple Developer Technical Support officially &quot;supported&quot; the use of the API.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000070more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>With Mac OS X the routines were tweaked and officially rolled into the operating system (and pulled from Jens&apos; site). The famous <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn2045.html\">Technote 2045</a> describes the official API and how to use it. The incredibly powerful <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Carbon/Reference/Apple_Event_Manager/apple_event_manager_ref/chapter_1.2_section_30.html\">AEBuildAppleEvent API</a> can be used to build a complex Apple Event with a stack of parameters using a single line call.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, working out the required &quot;AEGizmo&quot; string and getting the syntax right can be incredibly difficult. Apple provides no API for generating AEGizmo strings (although curiously it does provide a function, AEPrintDescToHandle, that produces output compatible with AEBuildDesc but <em>not</em> with AEBuildAppleEvent; why the two routines use different syntaxes is somewhat of a mystery).</p>\n\n<p>You can use the <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/Carbon/AppleEvents.html\">AEDebugSends and AEDebugReceives enviroment variables</a> to see pretty-printed information about incoming and outgoing Apple Events, but converting this information to AEGizmo format is a painstaking and error-prone process.</p>\n\n<p>You could also use some <a href=\"http://www.unsanity.org/archives/000107.php\">gdb trickery as described here</a> but you won&apos;t get the results that Rosyna says you should:</p>\n\n<pre>core\\getd{ ----:obj { form:&apos;prop&apos;, want:&apos;prop&apos;, seld:&apos;pnam&apos;, from:&apos;null&apos;() }, &amp;csig:65536 }</pre>\n\n<p>What you actually get is this (at least on Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.4.1; I don&apos;t know about previous versions):</p>\n\n<pre>&apos;core&apos;\\&apos;getd&apos;{ &apos;----&apos;:&apos;obj &apos;{ &apos;form&apos;:&apos;prop&apos;, &apos;want&apos;:&apos;prop&apos;, &apos;seld&apos;:&apos;pnam&apos;, &apos;from&apos;:&apos;&apos;null&apos;&apos;() }, &amp;&apos;csig&apos;:65536 }</pre>\n\n<p>Feed a string like that to AEBuildAppleEvent and you&apos;ll get a syntax error. In some cases with strings like this you can correct the syntax errors but you may find that AEBuildAppleEvent doesn&apos;t return the results you expect even if it does execute without returning any errors. The reason these strings are inadequate is that they&apos;re generated by AEPrintDescToHandle, which is not intended to be used with AEBuildAppleEvent. The above example correctly formatted as a true AEGizmo string would look like this:</p>\n\n<pre>&apos;----&apos;:obj {form:prop, want:type(prop), seld:type(pnam), from:&apos;null&apos;()}</pre>\n\n<p>Prior to Mac OS X 10.4, you could use an application called <a href=\"http://software.oxalyn.com/aemonitor/\">AE Monitor</a> to watch Apple Events and convert them to AEGizmo strings. At the time of writing the current version (1.7.2) has not been updated to work on Tiger. I&apos;m not a big fan of REALbasic; I found the app to be slow, klunky, and to deviate too far from well-established Mac user interface standards for my liking <em>but</em> at least the app worked. It was fairly buggy, it crashed a lot, it cost $40, but it did produce AEGizmo strings that worked.</p>\n\n<p>Another option was and still is <a href=\"http://www.latenightsw.com/sd3.0/\">Script Debugger</a>. Script Debugger has an Apple Event log window which shows the same output as that produced by the AEPrintDescToHandle function; in other words, output which is incompatible with AEBuildAppleEvent. If you launch Script Debugger in the Classic environment then it will fall back and use some older routines that it has based on the original AEGizmo code and it will produce output which in many cases does work with AEBuildAppleEvent. Nevertheless, you&apos;ll still find cases where the strings don&apos;t work with the new API, and the application itself costs $189; a hefty price tag if all you want to do is figure out the AEGizmo representation of a one-line AppleScript.</p>\n\n<p>In the course of developing <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> I&apos;ve had to work out a <em>lot</em> of AEGizmo strings. I&apos;ve written my own application for converting AppleScripts to the AEGizmo string equivalents. The application provides a basic interface which is like a simplified version of Apple&apos;s Script Editor. It supports syntax coloring, gives you a &quot;Compile&quot; and a &quot;Run&quot; button, and most importantly shows you the AEGizmo string representation of the script (and the reply, if there is one). If there is enough interest from developers, I&apos;ll package it up and release it with a fairly low price tag.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Yesterday&apos;s update to Mac OS X Tiger (now at version 10.4.1) broke compatibility with <a href=\"http://c-command.com/spamsieve/\">SpamSieve</a>. Michael Tsai, the SpamSieve developer, had a 2.3.1 update ready to roll the same day to fix the problem.</p>\n\n<p>I tried this software last year and was very impressed with it but when my trial period expired I decided not to purchase a license because I didn&apos;t feel confident about spending $25 on something that relied on undocumented features of the operating system. It seems though that Michael Tsai will stay on top of things, so he&apos;s now got my confidence and my $25.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000071more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>If you get a lot of spam I recommend that you try SpamSieve now. It has a liberal 30 day trial period. I think it&apos;s the number one anti-spam solution on the Mac. Since I began my trial it&apos;s filtered 35,000 good messages, 6,000 spam messages, and it&apos;s maintained a 99.3% accuracy rating (which improves every day).</p>\n\n<p>The other thing which may not be immediately clear is that SpamSieve is good for filtering out any mail that you don&apos;t want to see, not just spam in the strict sense of &quot;unsolicited commercial mail&quot;. For example, I&apos;ve used it to filter out bounce messages that I don&apos;t want to read, &quot;out of office&quot; autoreplies, and those horrible challenge-response messages sent by other anti-spam products.</p>\n\n<p>I think this latter class of messages is just as bad as the spam that it tries to combat; it places a burden on legitimate senders while spammers simply ignore it and go about their merry business. This is what I wrote about the subject back in 2003 and the situation hasn&apos;t changed:</p>\n\n<blockquote>I feel that challenge-response anti-spam mechanisms are an inappropriate means for dealing with the spam problem, and that modern mail clients such as Apple&apos;s Mail offer a more elegant and appropriate response to the situation. People should be using anti-spam technology that makes life more difficult for spammers, and not for legitimate users.</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&apos;s a system that I won&apos;t buy into &#x2014; and you shouldn&apos;t either &#x2014; and so all such challenge messages get automatically routed to the trash. If you respond to a challenge-response system then you implicitly indicate that you are prepared to make sending email into a manual two-step process. By accepting the system you encourage its further adoption. Would you like to live in a world where every single message you sent was met with a challenge?</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>I just read <a href=\"http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0505fm8.html\">this article</a> at rumor site <a href=\"http://www.thinksecret.com/\">Think Secret</a>, where they claim that &quot;FileMaker Developer 7&quot; will be renamed to &quot;FileMaker Pro 8 Advanced&quot; in its next version.</p>\n\n<p>I know that some have questioned why I chose to name my new product &quot;<a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a>&quot;, but this move by FileMaker seems a little bit ridiculous to me. In this short article I want to make some comments about the rumored move and also explain why my own products are named the way they are.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000072more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>Why so many adjectives?</h4>\n\n<p>It&apos;s fairly common in this industry to tape adjectives onto the end of product names to make them sound more impressive; &quot;Pro&quot;, &quot;Plus&quot;, &quot;Professional&quot;, &quot;Extra&quot;, pretty much anything which will sound good. In some cases these additions serve to differentiate one version of a product from another with more or less features. You can choose to run the &quot;Pro&quot; version or the &quot;Lite&quot; (sic) or &quot;Standard&quot; versions.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of &quot;FileMaker Pro&quot; there is no &quot;non-pro&quot; version so the &quot;Pro&quot; doesn&apos;t actually serve to differentiate the product from another. In this modern age of minimalism perhaps the name &quot;FileMaker&quot; would be better for marketing purposes, and certainly easier to type.</p>\n\n<p>But adding <em>yet another</em> adjective to form &quot;FileMaker Pro 8 Advanced&quot; when there is already one redundant adjective in the name seems to be going too far. What&apos;s next? &quot;FileMaker Pro MX Advanced XP Plus 2006&quot;? When will it stop?</p>\n\n<p>Here&apos;s my free advice to FileMaker Inc: simplify your naming and center on the FileMaker brand. Dump the word &quot;Pro&quot; from the entire product range. In fact, dump the version number as well. It&apos;s good to know that you&apos;re currently shipping version 7, and that 8 will be coming out in the future, but there&apos;s no need to use the version number on every single page on your website. If you insist on having multiple versions of the same product go with this lineup:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>FileMaker</li>\n  <li>FileMaker Server</li>\n  <li>FileMaker Developer</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>No need for &quot;FileMaker Pro Mobile 7&quot; (which runs on Palm OS and Pocket PC); just call it &quot;FileMaker&quot;. Hard to see why you have &quot;FileMaker Pro Server 7&quot; and &quot;FileMaker Pro Server 7 Advanced&quot;; these should probably be collapsed into a single product. In fact, I&apos;m not even sure I like the fact that you&apos;ve got that client/server/developer distinction. I think it should be one product with a single name, &quot;FileMaker&quot;. If you want to charge more for server licenses then go for it, but keep the unified name (it&apos;s good enough for <a href=\"http://www.mysql.com/\">MySQL</a>, after all).</p>\n\n<h4>My own naming policies</h4>\n\n<p>If you&apos;ve seen my own <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/\">products</a> you&apos;ll be quick to point out that perhaps I&apos;m not practising what I&apos;m preaching. But there is a method in my madness, as well as some mistakes and some lessons learned.</p>\n\n<h5>Synergy</h5>\n\n<p>Originally just called Synergy, now called Synergy Classic, I changed the name to differentiate it from my new product Synergy Advance. In hindsight I probably could have left its name untouched; people are smart enough to know that &quot;Synergy&quot; and &quot;Synergy Advance&quot; aren&apos;t the same thing. I also see that the word &quot;Classic&quot; has confused some users who mistakenly think that means it runs on Mac OS 9. This leads to the cumbersome practice of referring to it as &quot;Synergy Classic for Mac OS X&quot;. I chose &quot;Classic&quot; because I wanted to indicate the fact that the program has a lengthy heritage; and words like &quot;Lite&quot; or &quot;Standard&quot; were just wrong because they implied that the product was a cut-down version of Synergy Advance (when it&apos;s actually a separate product in its own right).</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s probably too late to alter this decision now but I will probably use the word &quot;Classic&quot; less and less in the future. Lesson learned, time to move on.</p>\n\n<h5>Synergy Advance</h5>\n\n<p>When I started work on this new product I needed a new name. The app works in the same space as Synergy, and the word &quot;Synergy&quot; already has a significant brand built up around it, so I wanted to use that word in the name. I liked &quot;Advance&quot; better than alternatives like &quot;Pro&quot; because it communicates that this is a new product written from scratch and not merely the same old Synergy with some other stuff bolted onto it. It&apos;s also a bit less cliched than &quot;Pro&quot;.</p>\n\n<h5>WinSwitch</h5>\n\n<p>I wasn&apos;t feeling very creative the day I came up with this name. &quot;Wincent&quot; + &quot;Switch&quot; = &quot;WinSwitch&quot;. I guess it serves its purpose, even if the name doesn&apos;t have a lot of intrinsic beauty. One downside that I soon discovered was that many people associate the prefix &quot;Win&quot; with &quot;Windows&quot; and for some reason consider it offensive and insulting that I name my product that way... I&apos;ve received angry emails, threats and abuse about it, believe it or not. I guess this is the response of what&apos;s known as the (very) vocal minority.</p>\n\n<p>This wasn&apos;t the first product I&apos;ve made that starts with &quot;Win&quot; and it won&apos;t be the last (if I release <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2005/05/aegizmo_aebuild.php\">this product</a> it will most likely be called WinGizmo), but as a general rule I&apos;ll be avoiding names like this where practical in the future. The Mac audience is very particular about these things...</p>\n\n<h5>WinHex</h5>\n\n<p>Pretty much the same story as WinSwitch, &quot;Wincent&quot; + &quot;Hex&quot; = &quot;WinHex&quot;. Another simple but uninspiring name. In the next version of the software I&apos;ll actually be changing the name to Hextrapolate. Goofy, I know, but memorable. The reason is that there is <a href=\"http://winhex.com/\">another product</a> out there called &quot;WinHex&quot; and it&apos;s been around for quite a few years; the makers have asked me to change the name to avoid confusing their customers. Fair enough.</p>\n\n<h5>Install</h5>\n\n<p>I think I got this one right, as you can&apos;t get much simpler than &quot;Install&quot;. I wanted to follow Apple&apos;s trend of giving their apps simple names like &quot;Mail&quot; and &quot;Address Book&quot; (a trend they have clearly departed from with recent releases like Safari, Expos&#xE9; and Dashboard). The one downside is that you&apos;ll never get your hands on a domain name like &quot;install.com&quot; so the software has to live at <a href=\"http://install.wincent.com/\">install.wincent.com</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Branding</h4>\n\n<p>Branding is important, the company brand that is. &quot;Wincent&quot; is not a very pretty name but neither is it a common one so it makes for a good brand. I&apos;m far from famous but it <em>is</em> a name that is relatively well known among Mac users, mostly due to the articles I published before Mac OS X 10.0 came out; in those days wincent.org used to get half a million page views per month (a significant amount in those days, although today a truly popular site would need to rack up that kind of hit count every day). I don&apos;t write those sensationalistic articles any more but wincent.com still gets well over a quarter of a million page views per month; miles away from the most popular Mac sites but still enough to qualify as a blip on the radar.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Synergy&quot;, although known to a lot of Mac users isn&apos;t so useful as a brand name because its meaning is diluted by use for so many other purposes. Consider that if you search Google for &quot;synergy mac&quot; you&apos;ll get about half a million hits (out of about eight million hits that use the word &quot;synergy&quot;). In comparison &quot;wincent mac&quot; gets you  over 50,000 hits out of about 130,000 pages that use the word &quot;wincent&quot;. If you compare the ratios you&apos;ll see that the word &quot;wincent&quot; is much more densely/strongly associated with me and my company, which is exactly what you want when you are trying to build up a brand in people&apos;s mindspace.</p>\n</div></div>",

To make matters worse their underhanded, anti-competitive efforts are shrouded by a sickening cloud of rhetoric and marketing about how innovative they are.</p>\n\n<p>I don&apos;t hold anything against them for wanting them to maximise their profits but I do object to the fact that they insist on doing it in a way that harms consumers rather than benefits them. I think it&apos;s possible to do both, maximise profits <em>and</em> benefit consumers, but evidently MS doesn&apos;t share that philosophy.</p>\n\n<h4>Rip-offers (Riper-offerers?)</h4>\n\n<p>Companies that take open source software (licensed under the GPL), strip the copyright notices and incorporate the code into their commercial products. There&apos;s nothing wrong with using GPLed code in a derivative commercial product but if you distribute that product the license requires you to make the source code of it available under the GPL as well, something that these companies refuse to do. In fact, when faced with forensic evidence showing that their software contains the stolen code they deny its presence, squirm, wriggle, try to intimidate with legal threats and frantically try to cover their tracks by altering the binaries and surreptitiously replacing the copies on their servers. Caught red-handed all they can do is lie themselves deeper into the pit that they&apos;ve dug.</p>\n\n<h4>Patent profiteers</h4>\n\n<p>Some companies take out patents largely for defense. Not for defense of their good ideas but for defense from preemptive, profit-motivated legal attacks. Unfortunately in doing so they end up tacitly indicating their approval of the patent system and become part of the problem. Their conduct is not immoral but it is undesirable.</p>\n\n<p>Others take them out for offensive purposes. There&apos;s no doubt that these companies belong in the Hall of Scum.</p>\n\n<p>But the worst group of all are those who make patents their sole source of income. Instead of producing products they make their money by suing people who &quot;violate&quot; their patents. I have no respect for these people because they are like mindless parasites, contributing nothing to society or the public, working only to fill their coffers and those of their shareholders.</p>\n\n<p>The shareholders who invest in these firms, knowing full well that their business amounts to nothing more than attempted extortion, aren&apos;t too far from the bottom end of the moral scale either.</p>\n\n<h4>Spammers</h4>\n\n<p>Spamming is based on both greed and logic. Greed because the spammers want to make money and logic because experience shows that if you bombard millions of people with unsolicited mail then the law of averages states that at least some of them will take the bait, thus putting the spammer in front.</p>\n\n<p>Greed is a fairly common human vice and I won&apos;t be the one to cast the first stone. What makes these spammers&apos; actions most reprehensible (and definitely worthy of having a few stones cast in their direction) is not that they&apos;re greedy but that they blatantly and overtly try to circumvent people&apos;s desire for privacy and to be left alone.</p>\n\n<p>Analyze any spam mail in your inbox and you&apos;ll see all sorts of evidence that the spammer <em>knows</em> that you didn&apos;t want to receive it, that they decided to send it anyway, and that they used all sorts of devious technical trickery in an effort to get past the barriers you put in place to block the spam. The spammer therefore not only knows that you&apos;re not interested in receiving spam but also that you&apos;ve explicitly done your best to prevent it from being delivered. That is, you&apos;ve expressed a preference <em>and</em> you&apos;ve taken steps to ensure that it&apos;s respected. Well, the spammers couldn&apos;t give a damn about lofty ethical concepts like &quot;respect&quot; so they decide to side-step your decision and fill your mailbox anyway.</p>\n\n<h4>Scammers</h4>\n\n<p>Scammers are even lower on the moral ladder than spammers. These are the people who send you fake messages pretending to be from your bank and asking you to update your credit card details. While spammers are a bunch of highly unethical &quot;entrepreneurs&quot;, scammers are nothing more than fraudsters, thieves and crooks.</p>\n\n<h4>Spyware and adware authors</h4>\n\n<p>Another despicable bunch. Instead of coming up with something that people want and that enriches their lives they dishonestly try to inflict their wares on unwilling users in an effort to make profit from people who never elected to be their &quot;customers&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s part of the nature of capitalism that advertising takes on ever more pervasive forms: in books, magazine, television, on the Net, on billboards, on the sides of our buses, written in the sky, emblazoned on our very clothing and bodies. It&apos;s one thing for advertisers to find new arenas in which to compete for the public&apos;s attention, but it is another matter entire for a mindless profiteer to circumvent somebody&apos;s privacy and install software on their computer against their will.</p>\n\n<h4>Virus and worm writers</h4>\n\n<p>Not much to say about this bunch of mindless vandals (and that&apos;s exactly what they are: mindless vandals whose sole purpose is to destroy. When was the last time you heard about a politically motivated virus author?).</p>\n\n<h4>Pirates</h4>\n\n<p>As a small software producer I feel the brunt of piracy. These people, who believe that they are entitled to stuff for free, put small software companies out of business or drain the resources available to them for development. Everybody else loses out because the direct consequences of piracy are: fewer products, fewer companies competing in the arena, fewer features (because piracy saps development time), and tougher anti-piracy measures for everybody (including those who have never pirated anything).</p>\n\n<h4>Cloners and Copiers</h4>\n\n<p>People who can&apos;t come up with their own ideas for software, so they decide to copy the good ideas of someone else. Personally, I think these people should get another job.</p>\n\n<h4>Search engine &quot;optimizers&quot; (SEOs)</h4>\n\n<p>A new category of euphemistically-named scum, these are people who will use any means, fair or foul, to get your site ranked higher in the search listings. Want to promote your product? Instead of improving it and building up a popular base of interest and support just pay a SEO! The SEO in turn doesn&apos;t contribute anything to society. He or she &quot;works&quot; only to get his share of the money. His less than ethical goal is to earn your site a place in the search engine rankings that it couldn&apos;t gain through merit.</p>\n\n<h4>Leechers</h4>\n\n<p>If you&apos;ve ever used BitTorrent you&apos;ll know that the idea behind distributing files using the &quot;swarm&quot; is that everybody shares a bit of the load of distribution. Unfortunately there are a lot of people out there who for some unknown reason believe that they have a greater entitlement to the content being distributed (and less of an obligation to share in the work of distributing it). The leechers I refer to here are not the &quot;leechers&quot; in the technical sense of &quot;downloaders&quot; that are referred to in the BitTorrent documentation; these are people who <em>dedicate</em> their attention to avoiding their social responsibility and actively work to exploit the system in their favour.</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;m sorry, but as Tyler Durden says in the movie <em>Fight Club</em>, &quot;You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.&quot; I couldn&apos;t agree more.</p>\n\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n\n<p>I&apos;m sure there are many other categories out there that I&apos;ve missed out in this short summary. It&apos;s a picture which is getting gloomier every year. Back when I first hit the Internet (1994) almost none of these categories existed (and if they did they existed in a different form). I wonder what the picture will look like in another ten years.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "file": "content/blog/10.4.1-kernel-panics-raid-and-data-integrity",
    "html": "<p>A few days ago I had my first kernel panic since I bought this machine. I&apos;m fairly obsessive about data integrity because the work I do using this machine is my sole source of income. That means using journalling on the filesystem (from the very first day it was available), storing all of my source in a Subversion repository, burning daily backups of my entire home directory to DVD, running a mirrored RAID configuration, having a UPS in between the computer and the mains outlet, and running Disk First Aid whenever I have an unclean shutdown (euphemism for &quot;hard reset&quot;, &quot;irrecoverable freeze&quot;, &quot;total system crash&quot; or &quot;kernel panic&quot;).</p>\n\n<p>Needless to say I wasn&apos;t too happy when I saw the first kernel panic. It was the first of many. Yesterday I had two more panics, the day before that there was another, and in the wee small hours of this morning I had yet another. All of these panics have occurred since upgrading to Mac OS X 10.4.1. I haven&apos;t yet established a clear pattern but all of them have occurred when using the Finder (for example, double-clicking to launch a file or right-clicking and inspecting the contextual menu).</p>\n\n<p>If you add these kernel panics to the total number of hard resets I&apos;ve been obliged to perform on this machine you get a MTTF (Mean Time To Failure) of about 10 days. (How do I know? Because I keep a log of involuntary reboots... like I said, I&apos;m fairly obsessive.) This is a disappointingly low figure, especially when you take into account that I look after this machine like a baby; it&apos;s a very clean install with the absolute minimum of third-party tools installed. The recent average has taken me back to the &quot;good old days&quot; of Mac OS 7, 8 and 9 where having your machine come crashing down like a meteorite taking all of your unsaved changes in any open application with it was a completely normal (and unstoppable) occurrence.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000083more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>The troubleshooting saga, phase 1</h4>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve barely slept a wink since last night as I&apos;ve tried to troubleshoot and solve this problem. It comes at an inconvenient time because I am trying to prepare a new public preview release of Synergy Advance for release at the end of this month. I have backups so I haven&apos;t lost any work, but right now the machine is unusable (more on this below) and so work is at a standstill.</p>\n\n<p>After kernel panic number four last night I booted off the Tiger install DVD and ran Disk First Aid (DFA) on the RAID. It reported two alarming errors (both &quot;No nombre&quot;, &quot;No name&quot; in English), attempted to repair them, automatically re-verified after the repair (something I&apos;ve never seen before) and even though the verification seemed to work informed me that the disk could not be repaired. I ran DFA again and it said the disk was fine.</p>\n\n<p>Upon reboot I got kernel panic number five as soon as I started using the Finder and decided to boot off the DVD again. No DFA errors, but in the RAID tab of the Disk Utility it said the RAID group was &quot;corrupto&quot; (corrupt). I use the word &quot;group&quot; here because that&apos;s what it said in Spanish (&quot;grupo&quot;); I don&apos;t know if in the English version of Disk Utility it employs the word &quot;array&quot;. This is somewhat of a chicken and egg syndrome because I cannot know if the kernel panics led to the RAID corruption or the RAID corruption led to the kernel panics; but either way it&apos;s obvious that there&apos;s probably a nasty feedback loop at play wherein every kernel panic gets the RAID into a less consistent state which in turn increases the likelihood of future panics.</p>\n\n<p>In the RAID details tab it said the group was &quot;corrupto&quot; and the first of the two disks in the array was marked as &quot;pausa&quot; (paused, whatever that means). The second disk had no special markings. All three items (the group as a whole and the two disks in the array) were marked with a padlock.</p>\n\n<p>The RAID tab has a little button labelled &quot;Reconstruir&quot; (Rebuild) which supposedly is for use in this type of situation. It didn&apos;t work. After a few seconds the Disk Utility changed the word &quot;pausa&quot; to &quot;error&quot;. I tried removing the faulty disk from the array. The &quot;Reconstruir&quot; button was then removed from the user interface.</p>\n\n<p>I tried formatting the faulty disk; it checked out fine. I tried using the &quot;Restore&quot; function to copy the contents from the working disk to the newly formatted disk; fine again, although it did take about two hours. I think the disk is most likely fine at the hardware level, but that it got corrupted at the filesystem level. Despite this, however, the RAID group itself continued to be marked as &quot;corrupto&quot;. The Apple docs say that if you have a disk failure you can replace the disk, select one of the other disks in the array, and drag the new disk (on the left) into the list of disks in the RAID (on the right). Unfortunately, the Disk Utility wouldn&apos;t let me perform that particular drag-and-drop; I suspect the padlock indicates that the RAID group is locked and I am not allowed to make any modifications to it. Along the way I tried exiting and relaunching the Disk Utility as well as rebooting from the DVD again but it made no difference.</p>\n\n<p>At this point I was wondering what good the RAID was if there was no way of recovering from a failure of one of the disks.</p>\n\n<p>So what do I do now? There&apos;s a not-very-helpful help button in the Disk Utility user interface which has no effect when you click on it. If the existing RAID group was corrupt but one of the volumes in it was ok, I wanted to know if I could create a new RAID group and add the volume to it without any data loss. The Apple docs seem to indicate that deleting the group and then re-creating it is not an option because they imply that deleting the group deletes all the data on the volumes in the group. They say nothing about what happens when you add a volume to a new (empty) group, but I suspect the answer is that you lose the data on the disk.</p>\n\n<p>So I&apos;ve rebooted off the drive one last time, burnt one last backup of my home folder to DVD, and am in the middle of a 12-DVD backup of the contents of the rest of the drive using Impression. Impression is currently taking between 30 and 60 minutes per DVD. Four down, eight to go. Unfortunately, while this is going on I can&apos;t continue with my work because any changes I make won&apos;t be reflected on the DVDs.</p>\n\n<p>My plan is to finish the back-up and then brave the undocumented waters of Disk Utility and see what happens when I try to add the known good volume to an newly created RAID group. If I lose all my data then I&apos;ll be doing a low-level format and reinstalling absolutely everything from scratch from my backups. All up I estimate this little disaster will cost me well over 24 hours, 24 hours in which I&apos;ll be entirely unproductive. I suppose a clean install will be good to blow away the cobwebs, so to speak, but it will also mean that I have to reinstall all of my software, hunt for install disks and license records, and painfully migrate my personal and work data and settings from the DVD backups back onto the drive. Could end up costing as much as 48 hours, and I don&apos;t mean 48 calendar hours but 48 working hours...</p>\n\n<p>This whole experience has left me questioning the value of RAID as implemented in Mac OS X. I purchased two disk drives and effectively traded half their total capacity for data security, redundancy and recoverability. Looks like I got the redundancy but not the recoverability. I may as well just have had two normal disks and done daily security backups from one to the other. I haven&apos;t given up on Mac OS X RAID just yet, but I am disappointed with it. I just hope that this is doesn&apos;t happen again in the future.</p>\n\n<h4>Update</h4>\n\n<p>Well, things didn&apos;t work out like I hoped and I ended up spending a lot more time on recovery than I expected. I made notes as I went along and I include them below because perhaps some day they will help someone who finds themselves in a similar situation.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell the most valuable lesson learned is the following: If your RAID and/or drives get into such a bad state that Apple&apos;s own tools refuse to touch them then you may end up having to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Boot into single-user mode (but only if you&apos;ve got a wired keyboard, not a wireless one).</li>\n  <li>If necessary unplug the disks so that you are only working with one unit at a time.</li>\n  <li>Use the &quot;kextunload&quot; command to get rid of the AppleRAID kernel extension.</li>\n  <li>Use the &quot;pdisk&quot; command line utility to blast the partition map.</li>\n  <li>Zero all disks (do not just delete them).</li>\n  <li>Be prepared to wait a long time.</li>\n  <li>Make sure you know your special start-up keys.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4>Notes</h4>\n\n<p>Well, with the backup finally finished (and earlier than expected because Impression is incapable of splitting large files over more than two DVDs; I had to handle the largest file by hand) it was time to try and get this RAID up and running again.</p>\n\n<p>Another boot from the Tiger install DVD and more fruitless clicking in the Disk Utility UI. I finally tried the diskutil command line tool (see &quot;man diskutil&quot; for more info). According to the man page the following command will repair a mirror, assuming that the good disk is /dev/disk1s3 and the disk which is to be inserted into the array to replace the bad disk is /dev/disk0s3:</p>\n\n<pre>diskutil repairMirror /dev/disk1s3 /dev/disk0s3</pre>\n\n<p>This yielded the following messages on the screen:</p>\n\n<pre>Note:  Syncing data between mirror partitions can take a very long time.\nNote:  The mirror should now be repairing itself  [sic] You can check it&apos;s [sic] status using &apos;diskutil checkRAID&apos; [sic]</pre>\n\n<p>Running &quot;diskutil checkRaid&quot; reported that the RAID status was &quot;degraded&quot; and that the disk corresponding to /dev/disk0s3 was at &quot;0% (rebuilding)&quot;. About 90 minutes later it hit 100% and the raid status changed from &quot;degraded&quot; to &quot;online&quot;. I fired up Disk Utility and confirmed that it too showed the RAID as being online, and ran DFA again on the RAID and it reported no errors.</p>\n\n<p>Time to reboot. 20 minutes later the Mac was still at the grey startup screen with the Apple logo and the fans were roaring like hair dryers. Looks like the RAID wasn&apos;t doing so well after all. Time for another hard reset... I tried to reboot one more time and the result was the same. After stalling at the grey startup screen for some time (about eight minutes) the fans started to kick in and soon were roaring at full speed with no sign of letting up. I suppose I could have waited around for them to stop but chances are the machine was hung forever. Another hard reset (and another when I tried to reboot from the install DVD but evidently did keep the &quot;C&quot; key pressed for long enough, leading to another stall). Looked like I may have to do a clean install after all.</p>\n\n<p>On rebooting from the install DVD I saw that Disk Utility now reported both volumes in the RAID as &quot;sin conexi&#xF3;n&quot; (disconnected). I formatted both disks, called them &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Evil&quot;. Evil refused to format (claiming not enough free space) but I was able to create a partition that occupied the entire disk (thus wiping everything on it). I found that I could then format.</p>\n\n<p>I then created a new RAID and set &quot;RAID mirror AutoRebuild&quot; as specified in <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=DiskUtility/10.5/en/duh1013.html\">the docs</a>, something I didn&apos;t do last time and I wonder if that has anything to do with the problems I&apos;ve had (I also wonder why this box is not selected by default when you choose to create a mirror). It took a long time for Disk Utility hung at the &quot;Bringing RAID partitions online&quot; step. After nearly an hour of indeterminate progress bar and no disk noise at all I decided to abort and try again.</p>\n\n<p>On re-launching the Disk Utility I saw three physical drives in the list when there are in fact only two in reality (System Profiler shows only two). A bad sign. Time for a reboot. It was beginning to look more and more like Apple does not want Wincent Colaiuta to ever use RAID again.</p>\n\n<p>This time I not only wanted to format both disks but I was going to zero them as well, christening them &quot;Upper&quot; and &quot;Lower&quot;. Turns out though that I got another endless barber pole and no disk access noises at all so once again decided to abort. The &quot;Omitir&quot; (&quot;Omit&quot;) button didn&apos;t work when clicked. Disk Utility started beachballing as soon as I tried clicking on the menu so the only remedy was to try to Force Quit (which naturally didn&apos;t work) and then hard reset (the fourth for the day and the fifth involuntary reboot for the day if you also count the kernel panic).</p>\n\n<p>I didn&apos;t know whether the problem was limited to &quot;Upper&quot; only so I decided to try zeroing &quot;Lower&quot;. I got a message: &quot;Error en la escritura de ceros en el disco&quot; (&quot;Error writing zeros to disk&quot;), &quot;La escritura de ceros en el disco ha fallado debido al error: No se ha podido abrir el disco&quot; (&quot;The writing of zeros to the disk has failed due to the error: unable to open disk&quot;). I then tried to create a blank partition on the disk and got &quot;Bad file descriptor&quot; (in English this time). I got the same error again when I tried to format the disk without zeroing. Running DFA on this disk was not an option because the &quot;Repair disc&quot; buttons were ghosted for both the physical drive and the volume on the disc itself.</p>\n\n<p>I then tried formatting my old buddy &quot;Upper&quot;/&quot;Evil&quot; again but only got the barber pole and no disk activity. My old buddy, beachball, soon joined the party. Force Quit didn&apos;t work. Hard reset number five for the day. I decided to forget about using Disk Utility for now and after rebooting from the install DVD again went straight to the command line.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to get familiar with diskutil. I tried &quot;diskutil list&quot;, &quot;diskutil destroyRAID /dev/disk2&quot; (&quot;does not appear to be a RAID master&quot;), &quot;diskutil eraseDisk HFS+ Untitled1 disk0&quot; (stalled at &quot;Creating Partition Map&quot;), &quot;diskutil eraseDisk JournaledHFS+ Untitled1 disk0&quot; (also stalled at &quot;Creating Partition Map&quot;), &quot;diskutil eraseDisk JournaledHFS+ Untitled1 disk1&quot; (&quot;Partitioning encountered error Bad file descriptor (9) on disk disk1&quot;), &quot;diskutil partitionDisk disk0 1 JournaledHFS+ Untitled1 10GB&quot; (stalled again), &quot;diskutil partitionDisk disk1 1 JournaledHFS+ Untitled2 10GB&quot;, &quot;diskutil repairVolume disk0&quot; (&quot;Error (-9958) encounterd attempting to verify/repair disk0&quot;, &quot;diskutil repairVolume disk1&quot; (same error), &quot;diskutil repairVolume disk2&quot; (&quot;Can&apos;t open /dev/rdisk2: Resource busy&quot;).</p>\n\n<p>Next avenue: fsck. &quot;fsck -yf /dev/disk0&quot; (stalls forever, no output), &quot;fsck -yf /dev/disk1&quot; (reports &quot;(NO WRITE) BAD SUPER BLOCK: MAGIC NUMBER WRONG. LOOK FOR ALTERNATE SUPERBLOCKS? no&quot;), &quot;fsck -yf /dev/disk2&quot; (&quot;Resource busy&quot;).</p>\n\n<p>With &quot;fsck_hfs -yf&quot; I got almost identical error messages and hangs. Time for an attempted reboot, which yielded stall at spinning progress indicator, hard reset number six.</p>\n\n<p>Moving to an even lower-level tool I next fired up &quot;pdisk&quot; (see &quot;man pdisk&quot;). Trying to edit disk 0 warned me, &quot;The map is not writable&quot;. Trying with disk 3 hung forever after emitting a &quot;Resource Busy&quot; error message. Trying to reinitialize the partition map returned, &quot;can&apos;t open for writing, resource busy&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Shutdown (hard reset 7) trying to boot in single user mode... funnily, holding Command-S allowed me to boot into single user mode but I then couldn&apos;t type anything. Why did the Bluetooth keyboard work at power on but not after getting to the command prompt?</p>\n\n<blockquote>&quot;You can use a wireless keyboard to start up your Mac in Single-User mode or in Safe Boot mode. Once the computer is started up in these modes, however, the Bluetooth software controller is de-installed and will no longer work. To continue in Single-User mode or in Safe Boot mode you will need to use a wired keyboard and mouse.&quot;</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve heard the Apple explanation but I don&apos;t buy it. One thing I did end up buying, however, was an Apple corded (USB) keyboard. Hard reset number 8. Having to buy the keyboard just to use single-user mode was annoying because Apple charges full price when you buy a wireless keyboard and mouse from them, yet you don&apos;t get the wired keyboard and mouse that&apos;s included in the cost of the machine; they keep it. (In other words, they remove your corded keyboard and mouse from the box the machine comes in, keep it without offering you a reduction in price, and then they insert the wireless keyboard and mouse in the box, charging you full retail price for it.)</p>\n\n<p>29&#x20AC; later and I have a new Apple USB keyboard in front of me. Single user mode take two. Typing is a little difficult as the US keyboard map is used by default in single-user mode and this is a Spanish keyboard. Things like &quot;/&quot;, &quot;-&quot; and &quot;_&quot; aren&apos;t in the same place. I see a message like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>AppleRAID::completeRAIDRequest - error 0xe00002ca detected for set &quot;Toledo&quot; (1B18C9E1 ... 8046C2534682), Member 79681D5C ... 8861ADB48C50, set byte offset = 249925070848</blockquote>\n\n<p>Much to my surprise when I run pdisk again and try to initialize the partition map for disk0 I get the &quot;Resource busy&quot; message again. I try to edit disk1 and the program hangs, I do a Control-z and kill -9 of the pdisk pid but it has no effect. &quot;shutdown -h now&quot; hangs forever. In subsequent tries I must resort to using &quot;halt -nq&quot; or &quot;reboot -nq&quot;, which are barely better than yanking the power cord. Hard reset number 9.</p>\n\n<p>I reboot into single user mode again, trying pdisk on disk2 and getting the &quot;Resource Busy&quot; message. I get a hang on trying with disk0. Time for a quick &quot;reboot -nq&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Another reboot, another hard reset (number 10). I now tried disconnecting the drives one at a time and seeing what I could achieve in single-user mode. When I tried disconnecting drive that&apos;s in the upper bay I didn&apos;t see the completeRAIDRequest warning but after a few seconds at the prompt i see: &quot;AppleRAID::degradeSet - starting the set &quot;Toledo&quot; (1B18...)&quot;. I tried &quot;diskutil destroyRAID /dev/disk0&quot; (hangs). In fact, no diskutil command works on any disk, all hang, so I issued a &quot;halt -nq&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Plugged upper back in, unplugged lower, rebooted into single user mode. No &quot;completeRAIDRequest&quot; warning shown during boot, but after getting to the prompt saw the &quot;degradeSet&quot; warning and then the &quot;completeRAIDRequest&quot; warning. &quot;diskutil info disk0&quot; hangs. &quot;fsck_hfs -fy /dev/disk0&quot; returns &quot;AppleRAID: terminating set &quot;Toledo&quot; (1B18...)&quot; and &quot;Volume check failed&quot;. After a while, saw the degradeSet and the completeRAIDRequest warnings again.</p>\n\n<p>Finally I tried &quot;kextunload -c AppleRAID&quot; and it responded that &quot;terminate instances for class AppleRAID succeeded&quot;. At that point pdisk let me overwrite the partition table! Unplug, plug in the other, kextunload and overwrite partition table for that disk. Shutdown, plug in again, reboot from DVD.</p>\n\n<p>Things are starting to look good. I&apos;ve finally managed to drag Apple&apos;s tools, kicking and screaming, to the point where they&apos;ll actually let me erase my disks. But the good times won&apos;t last for long. I try to create RAID and it tells me &quot;La creaci&#xF3;n del grupo RAID ha fallado debido al error: No se ha podido crear una nueva fracci&#xF3;n&quot; (&quot;The creation of the RAID group failed due to error: Unable to create new fragment&quot;). I try to format the disk and write zeros to it but get &quot;No se ha podido abrir el disco&quot; (&quot;Unable to open disk&quot;). I try to zero the second disk and it seems to work (although it takes a long time).</p>\n\n<p>I was still getting assorted errors on first disk (&quot;Bad file descriptor&quot; and the like) so I went back to the command line, &quot;diskutil eraseDisk&quot; (works), &quot;diskutil zeroDisk&quot; (works). I was finally able to format both disks, create a new RAID, and DFA reports they are both fine, rebooted and DFA still reports that they are fine.</p>\n\n<p>But Apple had one more surprise in store for me. I rebooted from DVD and learned that the copy of Tiger that I received in return for my annual $500 membership fee is not a full install disk but is actually an &quot;upgrade&quot; DVD. So Apple wants me to install Panther first. But how to eject the DVD? It won&apos;t let me eject the DVD because it is the startup disk, and it won&apos;t let me shut down the computer either; for some reason all the menus offer me is &quot;Restart&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I couldn&apos;t remember the key to hold pressed to get a startup menu and neither could I look it up on the net using my unbootable machine so I rebooted as &quot;NetBoot&quot; client, thinking that when it failed to boot it would hopefully show me a menu or at least let me eject the DVD. I held the eject button, the disk popped out and while I was looking for another boot disk the tray shut.</p>\n\n<p>This was Apple&apos;s one last joke at my expense. Now I was at a grey screen with a slash symbol on it, the fans started to roar like fucking crazy. The eject key does not work. I will have to hard reset. Again. Number 11 and the first for my brand spanking new RAID.</p>\n\n<p>At this point <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=106178\">Command-Period</a> does not open the tray and the fans are getting louder and louder. I really should have started up by holding the Option key. What do I do now? Need I fear corruption of the new RAID due to the fact that I have yet another hard reset? Do I take a chance or do I reformat all over again? Zero all over again? Slash my wrists? Apple provides no way to open the tray that I know of and no way to get the system to restart other than hard resetting.</p>\n\n<p>I don&apos;t want to take any chances. I don&apos;t want this to happen again in the future and I&apos;ll forever wonder if it was because I allowed the corruption to take place at the very beginning. Hard reset. Startup with option key. Documented feature (Command-Period) to open tray does not work. Miraculously, the eject button does work. Boot from DVD. Terminal.</p>\n\n<pre>diskutil destroyRAID disk2\ndiskutil zeroDisk disk0\ndiskutil zeroDisk disk1\ndiskutil partitionDisk disk0 1 JournaledHFS+ Virgen0 10GB\ndiskutil partitionDisk disk1 1 JournaledHFS+ Virgen1 10GB</pre>\n\n<p>Run DFA on both, create RAID &quot;Toledo&quot;, run DFA on RAID, reboot, run DFA on RAID, install Tiger from the retail CD instead of the ADC one. Reinstall all apps. Restore files from backups. This whole thing has now cost me about 48 hours. I really hope it doesn&apos;t happen again.</p>\n\n<h4>More fun</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Monday 30 May 2005, 2:10 AM</strong>: The fun isn&apos;t over yet.</p>\n\n<p>Well, looks like all my efforts were for naught.</p>\n\n<p>After spending several hours restoring from backups, reconfiguring and reinstalling I have tried to reboot the computer because some of the installed software required it and as I write this it is at the blue screen with the spinning progress indicator (it&apos;s now been at that stage for about 30 minutes). So it looks like I have a hardware problem after all, although I don&apos;t know which disk is at fault. I am now into my 72nd hour of this ordeal.</p>\n\n<p>I did do a small amount of coding today which I could have lost, and I could also lose much of the email that I received while I was trying to restore the computer today. Evidently that&apos;s something that I&apos;d like to avoid if possible.</p>\n\n<p>The UI provides no feedback at this point but my guess is that the RAID is corrupt and the system is trying to repair it or at least operate in a degraded state. I will leave the computer running -- thankfully for once the fan is not roaring like a blow heater -- all night if need be. If it doesn&apos;t recover eventually I will have to do <i>another</i> hard reset and try booting with one of the drives unplugged. [<em>Later on I realized it wasn&apos;t a RAID problem but a software problem, possibly caused by Virtual PC.</em>]</p>\n\n<p>If I can boot successfully with one drive but not the other I will know which one is faulty and remove it from the machine permanently. I hope that I can recover the files that were modified today. [<em>I even went so far as to start looking up hard drive prices, but now it once again looks like a software issue.</em>]</p>\n\n<p>After waiting three hours at the spinning progress indicator with no audible disk access I decided to hard reset.</p>\n\n<p>Power on with option key held down. Command-Period, the Eject button and left mouse all fail to open tray. Tried plugging in corded keyboard, same result. Hard reset #2.</p>\n\n<p>Power on with option key held down. Both disks in RAID set appear in the boot menu (as &quot;Toledo 1&quot; and &quot;Toledo 2&quot;). This time seeing as the corded keyboard was plugged in the whole time the Eject button did work (question: why does Apple allow the Bluetooth keyboard&apos;s option key to work at power on but not the eject key?)</p>\n\n<p>Boot from Tiger install DVD. Run Disk Utility. RAID array is marked as being &quot;Online&quot; and no warnings shown. Run DFA on RAID (buttons are ghosted for the individual drives so can only run it on the RAID as a whole): DFA reports no errors. Also ran it on the virtual RAID volume: no errors reported.</p>\n\n<p>Fire up Terminal. Look at &quot;/Volumes/Toledo/private/var/log/system.log&quot;. Some interesting entries from the the just before the failed boot attempt:</p>\n\n<pre>21:31:37 kernel[0]: jnl: flushing fs disk bugger returned 0xd\n21:31:37 kernel[0]: disk7s2: device is write locked.\n21:31:37 kernel[0]: jnl: do_jnl_io: strategy err 0xd\n21:31:37 kernel[0]: jnl: write_journal_header: error writing journal header!</pre>\n\n<p>I hope this isn&apos;t indicative of grave problems with the disk.</p>\n\n<pre>21:41:04 shutdown: reboot by wincent:\n21:41:04 SystemStarter[19381]: &quot;/Library/StartupItems&quot; failed security check: permissions\n21:41:04 SystemStarter[19381]: &quot;/Library/StartupItems&quot; failed security check: not owned by GID 0\n21:41:05 SystemStarter[19381]: authentication service (19389) did not complete successfully\n21:41:07 SystemStarter[19381]: The following StartupItems failed to properly start:\n21:41:07 SystemStarter[19381]: /System/Library/StartupItems/AuthServer</pre>\n\n<p>The &quot;start&quot; above is spurious because it was actually shutting down at the time I think...</p>\n\n<p>Open &quot;Startup Disk&quot;. Use &quot;Shutdown&quot; menu item (so there is a way to shutdown rather than restart using the UI). Power on, hold Shift key after startup chime to force booting in &quot;safe mode&quot;. Boots. Warnings about permissions on Virtual PC items installed in /Library/StartupItems/ (thanks Microsoft).</p>\n\n<p>After correcting permissions attempt reboot (not in safe mode). Boots. Gets to Finder. Autolaunched apps start to bounce in Dock. I try to drag a Terminal window. Kernel panic #1.</p>\n\n<p>Boot from Tiger DVD. Disk Utility. RAID shows as &quot;online&quot;. DFA on RAID and on virtual volume.  No errors reported.</p>\n\n<p>Reboot with Shift key held (safe mode).</p>\n\n<p>What is causing the problem? Virtual PC? USB Overdrive? AlchemyTV DVR? (all seemed to work fine on 10.4)</p>\n\n<p>Upgrade Virtual PC from 7.0 to 7.0.1. Uninstall USB Overdrive. Reboot. More warnings produced by Microsoft Virtual PC about inappropriate permissions (repair). Remove items added automatically to login items by installers without permission.</p>\n\n<p>Reboot. Fingers crossed that there will be no more kernel panics or freezes. I think for the next few days I&apos;ll be rebooting off the install DVD at least once per day and checking that the disks are error-free.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3:33 AM.</strong> The fun never ends. Another kernel panic on clicking on the Interface Builder icon in the Dock (attempting to launch it). On reboot a second kernel panic occurred (and the third for the evening) before I could even start to use the Finder. Ironically all this occurred while I was midway through a backup of my home directory. This truly stopped being funny a while ago; I&apos;m doing my very best to repair this problem but it keeps striking the machine down along with my efforts to not only work but protect that work via backups. Not even OS 9 was ever this bad.</p>\n\n<p>Rebooted from the Tiger install DVD. Trying to use DFA to verify the RAID yields this in the log:</p>\n\n<pre>&quot;Nombre no v&#xE1;lido&quot; (in red, twice)\n&quot;Error: La tarea subyacente ha registrado un fallo a la salida&quot; (red)\n&quot;El volumen requiere reparaci&#xF3;n&quot;</pre>\n\n<p>And a sheet drops down which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Error de Primera Ayuda\nUtilidad de Discos has detenido verificando &quot;Toledo&quot; porque se ha producido el siguiente error:\nLa tarea subyacente ha registrado un fallo a la salida</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tried again, this time a repair (not a verify). Same &quot;Nombre no v&#xE1;lido&quot; errors, repairs, automatically verifies afterwards, then says, &quot;No se ha podido reparar un volumen&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Try repair again. Said, &quot;No se requer&#xED;an reparaciones&quot;. RAID continues to be marked as &quot;Online&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Just to be safe run repair on virtual volume as well. No errors reported.</p>\n\n<p>Reboot in safe mode (Shift key held down). Works.</p>\n\n<p>Reboot in normal mode. Works. Spotlight informs me that it will be unavailable for &quot;approximately three hours&quot; because it claims that it needs to reindex my drives.</p>\n\n<p>This really does take me back to the OS 9 days in more ways than one. We&apos;re not only talking about constant crashes but perhaps even more importantly, living in constant fear of crashes; so this means that you don&apos;t run multiple apps at a time for fear of conflicts and crashes, you don&apos;t leave things running unless they are absolutely necessary, and you hesitate to even touch your data for fear that the machine will crash will you are trying to work on it.</p>\n\n<p>Well, it&apos;s now 4 AM and I am rather tired of all this. Start back up (again) and hope it actually completes before the next kernel panic. Bed time.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>So we&apos;re moving to Intel. If it means more powerful computers then I&apos;m all for it. But I wince when I think about how painful the transition is going to be... It won&apos;t be painful for me as a developer; yes, I&apos;ll have to fork out the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html\">$999 for the Developer Transition Kit</a> and spend some time making sure that everything works on both PowerPC and Intel but I think I&apos;ll survive. But it <em>will</em> be painful for me as an end user.</p>\n\n<p>All those apps which I&apos;ve grown accustomed to using won&apos;t necessarily be there for me when I make the switch, that&apos;s what&apos;s going to hurt. Remember what it was like when Mac OS X first came out? Remember how long Adobe took to port Photoshop? (And remember how they entirely abandoned products like FrameMaker?) It&apos;s cold comfort to hear Adobe&apos;s CEO promise that they&apos;ll bring their apps over. The question is, <em>when</em>? And when will all the other vendors of the products I&apos;ve come to love and/or depend on? Yep, it&apos;s gonna be unpleasant. I sure hope that &quot;Rosetta&quot; proves to be an acceptable stop gap measure... (I never had the stomach to use Classic...)</p>\n\n<p>Why didn&apos;t Apple make this jump years ago? They&apos;ve been producing Intel-compatible builds of all their major products for years now. The transition from the G3 to the G4 should have been a transition to Intel. Remember that painful period where the new G4s stalled at 500 MHz for well over a year? In fact, remember how Jobs announced machines with 500MHz G4s and then had to scale back the specs to 450MHz? And remember how he promised that the G5 would be different, that within 12 months the G5 would scale from 2GHz to 3GHz? Well, 24 months have passed and it has only scaled to 2.7GHz, less than half the improvement that Jobs assured. Debates with PC users were much more pleasant back in the days of the G3 when the PowerPC enjoyed a clear performance advantage in almost every department; for the last five or so years those debates have been far from enjoyable...</p>\n\n<p>We could&apos;ve been spared those painful periods of stagnation and had to deal with just one awkward transition (Mac OS 9/PowerPC to Mac OS X/Intel) instead of two (Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X and then PowerPC to Intel). I guess Jobs wanted to believe. He wanted to believe that IBM could deliver the goods. And he did believe, which is why he made the public promise about &quot;3GHz within a year&quot;. But Jobs doesn&apos;t like to be disappointed. First Motorola, and then Big Blue. Their failure pushed him over the edge and he&apos;s decided to make the jump to Intel, taking all of us along with him. Intel is not my favorite company in the world (and as far as x86 chips go I like AMD&apos;s current offerings better than those of Intel) but at least they&apos;ve reliably shown that they know how to consistently deliver improvements in performance over time.</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s just a little bit ironic that just when all three major games consoles are jumping to PowerPC chips, Apple is jumping in the other direction. But like I said, it&apos;ll be fine with me as long as end users get better machines as a result. I&apos;m hoping that the superior clock speeds and better compilers (I wonder if Apple will stick with GCC) will put an end to those embarrassing comparisons for games which run on both Mac and Windows platforms, yet which deliver vastly disparate framerates... I&apos;m skeptical but perhaps this will mean that we see more games ported to the Mac too; only time will tell. I&apos;m also hoping that Apple sticks with the multi-CPU pattern for their pro line of desktop machines. Mac OS X makes excellent use of multiple processors and it would be a shame to see it go to waste on a single-CPU machine. It will be nice to know that once again when you buy the top of the line Mac that you&apos;ll be buying the very best machine that money can buy; not just the &quot;best&quot; in terms of user experience but also the most powerful.</p>\n\n<h4>Update</h4>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve now seen the keynote video and feel a little more optimistic (Steve&apos;s Reality Distortion Field truly is amazing). I&apos;m inclined to think that this move will be worth it even if there are some growing pains along the way. I&apos;m a power junkie and I love fast machines, so I wasn&apos;t that hard to convince.</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve also read the &quot;Universal Binary Programming Guidelines&quot; available on Apple&apos;s developer website. 90% of my code is Cocoa so I am not anticipating too many problems in porting it. There are, however, some bits of Carbon and some other sections where I think the change from big to little endian is going to cause me some headaches. I also wonder what places in the code I&apos;m going to be bitten thanks to the different behaviour of the two platforms when messaging nil.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I am pleased about is that Xcode 2.1 offers better support for Unit Testing. Something tells me that we are all going to benefit from doing a heck of a lot of Unit Testing when doing this transition.</p>\n\n<p>I <em>like</em> the PowerPC architecture. I mean, emotionally, I am fond of it. I think it&apos;s more elegant. I like that it&apos;s big endian (little endian architectures just look plain illogical to me). I like that you can divide by zero without causing an exception. I like the way the Altivec functions have neatly formatted names. In comparison, there&apos;s lots about the Intel platform that strikes me as ugly. In the end though, Steve&apos;s argument has to win: Intel can deliver more power per watt, and that&apos;s what it&apos;s all about. It&apos;s the reason why we don&apos;t have a G5 laptop yet, why Apple had to implement liquid cooling in their top-of-the-line desktop machines (unheard of!), and why we&apos;re still running at 2.7GHz.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000089more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Yesterday Steve Jobs announced that Apple will transition to Intel processors. I&apos;m very excited about the move and I think it will be the best for Apple customers in the long run. In fact, even in the short term I think we&apos;ll see some benefits; I just wish they&apos;d done it sooner. I&apos;ve written <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2005/06/the_move_to_int.php\">a more personal response</a> on my <a href=\"http://colaiuta.net/\">weblog</a> but here I wanted to make an official statement on the position of Wincent Software with respect to the move.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000091more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>In short, Wincent fully supports the move to Intel processors. All Wincent <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/\">products</a> will be made available as &quot;Universal Binaries&quot; which will run on both the PowerPC and Intel platforms. I&apos;ve already ordered the Developer Transition Kit so you can rest assured that all Wincent products will be ready and heavily tested by the time the first Intel-based Apple machines are released to the market.</p>\n\n<p>My current understanding of Apple&apos;s plans is that the first Intel-based machines will ship with a version of Mac OS X that is based on the current Tiger operating system. Apple did not announce any plans to make available an Intel-compatible version of Jaguar or Panther; they hope that at least 50% of their installed base will be using Tiger by this time next year. This has implications Wincent applications which run on an older version of the OS. My understanding is that only applications that are compiled for Mac OS X 10.4 and up can be compiled as Universal Binaries; it is not yet clear to me whether I will have to prepare a separate (non-universal) version of applications for people who will run older versions of the operating system on PowerPC hardware.</p>\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">Synergy</a> runs on Mac OS X 10.2 and up. Because it includes a System Preferences pane it cannot use the &quot;Rosetta&quot; translation unit to run on the Intel version of Mac OS X. But because it must run on Jaguar neither can it be compiled as a Universal Binary. I will therefore do one of two things: either raise the minimum operating system requirement to 10.4 (thus allowing me to compile a universal binary) for future releases of the product (older versions would also continue to be made available for those who haven&apos;t yet upgraded to Tiger), or distribute a separate (non-universal) version for those that are still using an older version of the operating system. Either way I will be keeping the website up-to-date as more information becomes available, and I plan to ensure that people can continue to run Wincent Software on the platform and Mac OS X version of their choosing.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>I&apos;m a big fan of unit testing. I admit that I was at first put off by the puritanical fanaticism of some of its most vocal advocates (the kind that MashWordsTogether even when they&apos;re not writing in programming wikis about their <a href=\"http://www.xprogramming.com/xpmag/whatisxp.htm\">favorite</a> <a href=\"http://www.extremeprogramming.org/\">topic</a>) but there was no arguing with the basic premise that automated testing should lead to more robust, bug-free software.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000092more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>What&apos;s so good about unit testing?</h4>\n\n<p>I don&apos;t agree that &quot;Test Driven Development&quot; is the only way to write software but it&apos;s clear that once you start to unit test, no matter what your personal style is, you will find that your development patterns do start to incorporate moments of &quot;test-drivenness&quot;, even if only fleetingly. In reality there&apos;s an interplay between writing code, writing tests and writing documentation. I do all three, not always in the same order and often moving back and forth between them. Writing code is the most important, of course, because without it you wouldn&apos;t have a product, but the other two (testing and documenting) help you to write better code and often to come up with better designs. I write code-level API documentation even for code that I doubt anyone else will ever see because I find that doing so provides me with a discipline that leads to code that&apos;s better thought out (it&apos;s that open source idea that you&apos;ll write better code if you imagine you&apos;re writing for an audience than if you&apos;re not writing for anyone) and I think it also forces me to come up with more usable, better designed APIs. As an added benefit that documentation might come in handy in the future if I ever have to revisit very old code, or if I decide to open source it.</p>\n\n<p>The merit of automated testing is even more self-evident. The single most important benefit is that it helps you to find bugs. Secondary benefits are that it sometimes helps you to come up with better designs (if the code is awkward to test then it&apos;s probably awkward in normal use as well and perhaps that means a better design is possible).</p>\n\n<p>You&apos;ll also notice that you start to feel more confident about your code and about refactoring it. That confidence actually makes you more productive because if your newly written method passes the battery of tests that you&apos;ve written (including all the thorny edge cases) then you&apos;ll be that much more certain about blazing ahead and writing the next method, and the next, and the next. I think the extra speed at which you work more than offsets the time you must spend writing the tests.</p>\n\n<p>And as I said, you&apos;ll be more ready to refactor code if you&apos;ve got a battery of unit tests in place. That&apos;s a good thing because it liberates you from an &quot;if it ain&apos;t broke don&apos;t fix it&quot; philosophy that might otherwise dissuade you from implementing better designs. Unit testing gives you the confidence to refactor code because you know that it will help you to find any problems or bugs that creep in as a result of the changes, and refactoring is a good thing (or at least it should be!) which should lead you to code that is more maintainable, comprehensible, efficient, error-free.</p>\n\n<h4>Why unit testing suddenly became more important...</h4>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve used unit testing for some time in my products but for a long while I&apos;ve fallen short of what I would consider to be a &quot;comprehensive&quot; level of testing. In other words, I test some things that can be easily tested but neglect many things that I probably could and therefore should be testing. I did most of my testing with homegrown macros but I knew that there was scope for improvement so I started work on my own fully-fledged testing framework. There are already a number of frameworks out there but this was one particular wheel that I wanted to reinvent because I wanted a tool that exactly matched my requirements and way of working. Testing style and methodology for me is an intimately personal thing which had to just <em>feel right</em> if I was to practise it in a disciplined and methodical fashion. So I set about writing <a href=\"http://test.wincent.com/\">WOTest</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I had left WOTest on the back burner for a while though to work on more important things (well, at least <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">things that customers felt were more important</a>). Apple&apos;s recent announcement that it will be moving to Intel processors has dramatically changed my priorities. </p>\n\n<p>Automated testing will now be more important than ever because now we&apos;ll all be developing for two platforms. It will no longer be enough to test &quot;on the Mac&quot;. Now we must test on the Mac (PowerPC) and on the other Mac (Intel) too. There are all sorts of untested assumptions that could end up biting us and I&apos;d prefer to be protected.</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve bitten the bullet and ordered the Developer Transition Kit (my credit card company must love me) and I&apos;ve spent the last few days working on WOTest again. It was a great feeling to get to that &quot;bootstrap&quot; point at which WOTest could actually test itself:</p>\n\n<pre>Run summary:\nTests run:           551\nTests passed:        396 + 155 expected failures (100.00% success rate)\nTests failed:        0 + 0 unexpected passes (0.00% failure rate)\nUncaught exceptions: 0</pre>\n\n<p>Because it&apos;s a test framework I have to be sure that it not only knows how to handle success cases but failure cases as well. That&apos;s why you see two numbers in the &quot;Tests passed&quot; row above; one is the number of tests that passed (and which I expected to pass) and the other is the number which failed (and which I expected to fail). It&apos;s necessary to verify that tests not only work when you expect them to work but also that they <em>don&apos;t</em> work when you don&apos;t expect them to work.</p>\n\n<p>I still have a few more days of work before I&apos;ll consider it to be &quot;finished&quot; to 1.0 level, but the major design work has been tackled and now all that remains is writing tests and handling some implementation details. It&apos;s quite a powerful framework with a lot of functionality, and seeing as I have to have an extreme degree of confidence in the framework itself I will be writing lots and lots and lots of tests for it. I&apos;ve written over 500 so far but I expect the final figure could easily top 2,000 or more. It&apos;s not as bad as it sounds as they are quite easy to write, but still there are a lot of them...</p>\n\n<p>As I note on the <a href=\"http://test.wincent.com/\">WOTest page</a> this is an internal-use-only piece of software for now but if there&apos;s enough interest in making it available I&apos;ll think about what would be the best way to distribute it to developers in the future (what kind of license I should use and so forth). Let me know if you have any ideas.</p>\n</div></div>",

Most commonly you would throw an NSException object as shown below:</p>\n\n<pre>@throw [NSException exceptionWithName:@&quot;ExceptionName&quot; \n                               reason:@&quot;Invalid arguments&quot;\n                             userInfo:nil];</pre>\n\n<p>The trouble is, however, that you could conceivably throw other objects:</p>\n\n<pre>@throw @&quot;Exceptions are fun&quot;;</pre>\n\n<p>And this could cause trouble for you if your exception handler makes assumptions about what kind of object it will be passed as an exception. This could be particularly troublesome if you threw a class the did not derive from the NSObject root class or implement the NSObject protocol:</p>\n\n<pre>@throw [WORootClass trickyException];</pre>\n\n<p>In this case if your exception handler makes the assumption that the exception will respond to messages like <em>name</em>, <em>reason</em>, <em>userInfo</em> or <em>description</em> then you could end up crashing the program. There are not even any guarantees that the passed exception class will respond to messages like <em>conformsToProtocol:</em>, <em>respondsToSelector:</em>, <em>performSelector:</em>, <em>isKindOfClass:</em> or even the most basic <em>class</em>. You would normally use these methods to protect yourself from unknown conditions but if you try to invoke them on an object that does not derive from the NSObject (or similar) root class then you could find that your program crashes rather than raising a normal exception.</p>\n\n<p>Now it is true that you almost never see custom root classes on Mac OS X but that doesn&apos;t mean that they don&apos;t exist. For that reason for the last couple of days I&apos;ve been working on making <a href=\"http://test.wincent.com/\">WOTest</a> work with any kind of Objective-C object regardless of whether it derives from NSObject. As a testing framework it&apos;s extremely important that it be totally robust and that it catches exceptions regardless of what kind of object they are. As far as I know none of the other Objective-C unit testing frameworks have this capability (admittedly I don&apos;t have much knowledge of the internals of those frameworks).</p>\n\n<p>This involves some low-level manipulation of the Objective-C runtime but I&apos;m enjoying getting my hands dirty with it.</p>\n\n<p>My current challenge is that I am trying to figure out how to determine the return type of an Objective-C method dynamically at runtime. For example, consider the &quot;Object&quot; root class (implemented in libobjc which is open source and part of Darwin; see /usr/include/objc/Object.h). The Object class responds to the <em>name</em> selector but it returns a value of type &quot;const char *&quot; (unlike NSException which has a &quot;NSString *&quot; return type). If you send a <em>name</em> selector to this object you&apos;ll get a valid pointer back but you&apos;ll most likely crash the program if you make the mistake of assuming that it points to an NSString object.</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s true that this is probably not a very likely situation but it&apos;s one that I want to handle. I&apos;m implementing a number of high-level convenience methods in a category on NSObject that serve as wrappers for the low-level functionality that I&apos;m using. Once I&apos;ve solved this little problem I&apos;ll be able to use those wrappers to protect me in a number of other cases too (the <em>description</em> selector is one which springs to mind). I had a glance at the runtime documentation and I can&apos;t yet see where return type information is stored for the method definitions. Nevertheless if I run class-dump on libobjc or Foundation I see that it correctly distinguishes between id return types and const char *, so the information must be in there somewhere...</p>\n\n<h4>Update</h4>\n\n<p>Looks like the information is in the objc_method structure. The docs say that method_types &quot;contains the type encodings for the method&apos;s argument&quot; but a little bit of empirical testing shows that the string encodes not only the arguments but the return type as well...</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000093more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Well, continuing on from <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2005/06/handling_except.php\">my last post on the topic</a> I&apos;m blazing ahead with my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2005/06/unit_testing_an.php\">unit testing</a> framework, <a href=\"http://test.wincent.com/\">WOTest</a>. I&apos;ve gotten the custom root class support finished (and tested, of course!) and have now moved on to rolling in mock object support.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I&apos;ve never used mock objects in my own unit testing in the past but I think it will be something useful to add. There are a few design patterns that one could use to implement it (see how <a href=\"http://www.jmock.org/getting-started.html\">jMock</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nmock.org/\">NMock</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/software/OCMock/\">OCMock</a> do it) and of these I think the most attractive one is the &quot;<a href=\"http://cocoadev.com/index.pl?HigherOrderMessaging\">trampoline</a>&quot; pattern. The trampoline pattern is attractive because it allows a very minimal, elegant syntax, which is exactly what I&apos;ve strived for with the test macros used in the rest of the framework.</p>\n\n<p>OCMock is an extremely lean, cut-down implementation of the idea and it is open source, but I think it can be done in a better way: it&apos;s missing a few methods which I think are must haves and it is hamstrung by the fact that you cannot use it to create a mock object that responds to any selector that contains non-object arguments.</p>\n\n<p>The implementation I have so far implements a number of methods whose function should be self-evident if you&apos;ve had any experience with using mock objects (ironically, I haven&apos;t but I have been reading up on it over the last few days!): <em>accept</em>, <em>acceptOnce</em>, <em>reject</em>, <em>expect</em>, <em>expectOnce</em>, <em>expectInOrder</em> and <em>verify</em>. As always when writing Objective-C I&apos;ve tried to pick method names that are so self-evident that they are almost self-documenting (why is the OCMock equivalent of <em>accept</em> called <em>stub</em>? To me the relationship between <em>stub</em> and <em>expect</em> is far from self-evident, but that between <em>accept</em> and <em>expect</em> is immediately clear).</p>\n\n<p>There are still a couple of challenges to tackle:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Coming up with an elegant syntax that allows people to specify constraints on arguments</strong></p>\n\n<p>The default case is to require all the arguments passed at test time to exactly match those specified during set-up. The question is how to provide control over the constraints while still maintaining the simplicity and elegance of the current syntax. I have a few ideas but no clear winner yet. <a href=\"http://www.nmock.org/\">NMock</a> is a good example of the extreme case: it provides an amazing level of control but the cost is a high degree of syntactic complexity. To a lesser degree I&apos;m also wondering about what would be the best syntax for specifying return values.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Build mock classes that can handle class methods</strong></p>\n\n<p>OCMock allows you to set up mock object instances and send instance methods to them. What happens if you want a mock class that stands in for a class and accepts class methods? This is a problem that I&apos;ve only just begun to think about but it seems to me that in most cases you could design your tests in such a way that you only ever needed to send instance methods; but if you had the freedom to send class methods would you start working in another way? It&apos;s still early days so I don&apos;t even know if this is possible (I note that NSProxy does not declare a <em>forwardInvocation:</em> class method, although if you use class-dump you&apos;ll note that NSObject does even if it isn&apos;t documented). I suppose that the last resort case would be to throw NSProxy out the window and implement a new root class that handles this scenario.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000095more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>A few minor disasters and an unexpected event or two have taken place during this last month that have set back development a bit. Things are now getting back to normal; I&apos;m making this post to let you know that a new version of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/\">Synergy</a> is ready for release and the next public preview release of <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> will follow closely. Read on if you are interested in knowing what happened during this last month:</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000099more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>Hard disk failures on my development machine</h4>\n\n<p>Ouch. Despite my painstaking efforts to keep my one-and-only development machine in the best possible working order and to implement as many levels of protection as possible (filesystem journaling, RAID, UPS protection, daily backups and so forth) I suffered a series of kernel panics and crashes and my RAID got into an irrecoverable state. I lost over a week to troubleshooting and recovery. I made some notes about the very unpleasant process on my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/\">personal weblog</a> in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2005/05/1041_kernel_pan.php\">this article</a>. No data was lost overall thanks to my fanatical backup regimen, but I did lose a lot of time.</p>\n\n<h4>A personal crisis</h4>\n\n<p>A good friend of mine wound up in hospital with multiple fractures including a broken spine. She has no family here in Madrid and only a small number of friends so I&apos;ve been doing the best I can to support her. I&apos;ve spent enough hours in the hospital as part of my daily visits that I never really want to set foot in another again if I can help it. She was recently discharged and spent five days at my home where I did my best at being full-time nurse (totally unprepared for it!). She&apos;s now getting better and is staying with another friend, so I&apos;ll have more time to devote to development from this point on. It was just one of those situations where I felt that I was needed and that helping out was the right thing to do.</p>\n\n<h4>Apple&apos;s Intel announcement</h4>\n\n<p>Not really a crisis, a disaster, or a set-back (in fact it&apos;s something I am quite optimistic about) but it did prompt me to divert some development resources away from my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/\">existing products</a> and towards my unit testing framework. I wrote about why I think unit testing is particularly important in this transition in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2005/06/unit_testing_an.php\">this article</a> (other notes <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2005/06/handling_except.php\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2005/06/mock_objects_in.php\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<h4>Server downtime</h4>\n\n<p>A few days ago the wincent.com webserver went down like a stone just when I was ready to release an update to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/\">Synergy</a> (I had literally packaged the update the night before). It was a stressful situation because there was absolutely no indication that something was wrong, yet the server was up one minute and down the next; doubly nerve-wracking because the server is in Australia and I am in Spain.</p>\n\n<p>The server had been up for 40 days when it suddenly stopped responding. The only reason I had rebooted it 40 days earlier was to apply a security patch; prior to that it had an uptime of well over 400 days. The folk in the data centre tried powering it off and on again, and although the lights came on and the fans were spinning it was completely dead to the network.</p>\n\n<p>So a call to a $185/hour UNIX consultant and a couple of hours later, the server was back up. We still don&apos;t know what caused it; all we know is that the /usr filesystem got into a bad enough state that the machine went dead and wouldn&apos;t reboot. The consultant was able to run fsck and everything now appears to be working fine. This machine also has a RAID just like my development machine, but this makes the second time in one month in which a RAID hasn&apos;t been enough to save me from disaster. Luckily no data was lost and to my knowledge no customers were affected by the downtime.</p>\n\n<p>When I go back to Australia in August I plan to do some serious work on implementing a more robust server solution. I am thinking about retiring that server and replacing it with a pair of new servers in a failover configuration. I still have to sort out the technical details but I think it will be worthwhile for peace of mind given that I live so far away from the server.</p>\n\n<p>And so that&apos;s the summary of things that have happened this month which have ended up robbing me of quite a bit of development time. Things are returning to normal, however, so expect to see some releases soon: Monday for Synergy if all goes well and soon after that for Synergy Advance.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Since the disk corruption on the server <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2005/06/synergy_and_syn.php\">the other day</a> I have done a lot of thinking about how I could minimize downtime and speed-up disaster recovery. Unfortunately, it all costs a lot of money so I will probably leave things at the &quot;dreaming&quot; stage for some time before I move onto the &quot;action&quot; phase.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000100more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>The current set-up</h4>\n\n<p>The current server has served me very well since I bought it in mid-2002. There have been bugs and software problems from time to time (sometimes my fault, sometimes somebody else&apos;s) but the hardware itself has been rock solid. I wanted something very reliable and so I decided to buy a pre-built machine from <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/us/\">IBM</a> rather than trying to save a few pennies and building one myself.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to minimize my risk and my costs by buying only an entry-level server. There was some risk involved in the decision to move from paying others for hosting on a shared server to owning my own server and putting it in a colocation facility. I wanted to make the move because I was sick of service interruptions and bad service provided by other people. But full administrative control over the server would also come with a heap of responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>First up there was the financial outlay, undertaken at a moment when I hadn&apos;t even released my first product yet (credit card to the rescue)! Then there was the technical risk (the need to set-up, administer and maintain a UNIX server for the first time; which meant going beyond just setting up an Apache webserver to things like mail configuration, DNS set-up, mailing list management, Perl modules, NTP, FTP, SSH, jails, OS updates and a bunch of other stuff). Finally there was the fact that I was assuming responsibility for hardware failures; if a hard drive got frizzled I&apos;d need to take care of replacing it and recovering/restoring all the data. All of this was a bit dicier in the colocation context because I would have to do it all without physical access to the server (and if I wanted physical access at short notice I would have to pay $100 for the privilege). It&apos;s become even hairier since then because I&apos;m living in Madrid right now but the server continues to reside over 10,000 kilometres away in Australia.</p>\n\n<p>So I decided to go for a 1-Rack Unit server in IBM&apos;s xSeries. A 1-RU server would be cheaper because my colocation provider charges more rent the more rackspace you occupy. The current equivalent to the server I bought is the <a href=\"http://www-8.ibm.com/servers/eserver/au/xseries/x306.html\">306 model</a>; I don&apos;t know if the model numbers have changed much since I bought mine three years ago (was it called a 305 back then? I&apos;m not sure). The processors and buses are a bit faster, the drives bigger, more memory, but the machines are still basically the same in spirit.</p>\n\n<p>I hoped to make disaster recovery a bit easier by buying two disks and implementing software RAID (level 1, mirrored). The idea was that if one failed the system could continue to operate and I&apos;d just replace the dead drive. My recent experience showed me that it wasn&apos;t so straightforward. The &quot;/usr&quot; filesystem got inexplicably corrupted badly enough that the server dropped off the network and wouldn&apos;t reboot. Only someone standing in front of the server console in single-user mode could run &quot;fsck&quot; and return the machine to a bootable state.</p>\n\n<p>It appears that I didn&apos;t lose any data, only some time and some money, but things could have been much worse. The worst case scenario would have been the need to do a complete reinstall and restore from backups, which would have been a nightmare considering that I am in Europe and the server is on the other side of the world.</p>\n\n<p>I don&apos;t know how much grief the RAID saved me in this instance. It could be that without the RAID the system would have been completely hosed, but it also could be that the RAID made little difference. I&apos;ll never know.</p>\n\n<h4>The dream set-up</h4>\n\n<p>For some time now I&apos;ve been thinking about ways I could make disasters less disastrous and recovery more straightforward. I&apos;ve been researching having two servers in &quot;failover&quot; configuration (the slave watches the master and keeps a synchronized copy of everything on it and if the master ever goes down the slave takes over).</p>\n\n<p>So we&apos;re talking about retiring the old server and replacing it with two new servers set up as a failover cluster. Twice the rackspace, twice the rent, twice the hardware outlay, but hopefully also a huge increase in peace of mind and a near guarantee of 99.9999% uptime even in the event of multiple hardware failures.</p>\n\n<p>The dream set-up has a few key elements that are improvements over the old system:</p>\n\n<h4></h4>\n\n<p>The machine I&apos;ve been looking at is the IBM xSeries <a href=\"http://www-8.ibm.com/servers/eserver/au/xseries/x336.html\">336 model</a>. It uses Xeon processors instead of Pentiums and has more memory capacity, but I&apos;m really not interested in it for the improved performance that it boasts over its little brother the 305; the thing which interests me are its quick disaster recovery features.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas the 306 has &quot;quick swap&quot; drive bays that enable you to quickly change hard drives after powering down the 336 has proper hot swap bays (in fact you can stick up to 4 hot-swappable drives in its 1-RU form factor). It also has hot-swappable fans, a hot-swappable power supply, and you can even install an online spare in one of the memory slots and/or use memory mirroring to allow the server to keep running in the even that a DIMM should fail. Basically, if you&apos;re prepared to spend the extra money on the 336 and provision it adequately with spares then there should be very few hardware failures which would require you to take the system down.</p>\n\n<p>Another characteristic of the 336 is that it&apos;s capable of doing RAID 5 (the 306 can only do RAID 0 or 1). I&apos;m of the opinion that RAID 5 arrays are more robust than RAID 1 arrays and that disaster recovery is more straightforward. It is true that failures are more likely (if you have four drives instead two then the probabilities dictate that you&apos;ll most likely only have to wait half as long before you see at least one of them fail) but the idea is that the failures aren&apos;t so scary. My server OS of choice, <a href=\"http://www.freebsd.org/\">FreeBSD</a>, <a href=\"http://www.freebsd.org/releases/5.4R/hardware-i386.html#DISK\">supports</a> the IBM ServeRAID 6i card. </p>\n\n<p>And this would be a true hardware RAID and not a software one like I am currently using. I&apos;ve had two nasty experiences in this last month with software RAID (once on the server and once on my development machine here) in which the RAID has not been able to protect me from disaster. One of the weaknesses of software RAID is that the software to manage the RAID usually has to be loaded from the disk itself. If the disk gets too corrupted to read that software then the RAID will become unusable. Hardware RAID on the other hand is an abstraction layer that means the operating system never needs to know that it&apos;s working with a RAID; it sees the RAID as a single drive.</p>\n\n<p>The other investment I&apos;d want to make this time is probably in the IBM &quot;Remote Supervisor Adapter II&quot; which IBM claims &quot;provides remote management and control of the system independent of the server status, even if the server is powered off or otherwise disabled&quot;. I have to learn more about this product, but it sounds like it means you can remotely manage the server from any standard web browser. Sounds good to me. This would be really handy considering the distance between me and the server.</p>\n\n<p>One final advantage of the 336 over the 306 is that it comes with a 3-year warranty instead of a 1-year one. All round it seems to be a much more serious piece of machinery.</p>\n\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n\n<p>It seems that IBM is the only vendor which offers so many hot-swappable drive bays in a 1-RU server (I checked Dell and HP and both only offer 2 bays). Apple comes close with their Xserve unit (3 bays) at a cost of A$6454.01 (with a single G5 processor, three SATA drives and a hardware RAID controller).</p>\n\n<h4>Conclusions</h4>\n\n<p>All of this comes at the price of a pretty penny. If you want RAID 5 with 4 hot-swap drive bays your base model will cost you A$3,699 (this is the bare system with no drives, 1 GB of RAM, and a single 3.0GHz Xeon processor). Add to that A$779 for the IBM ServeRAID-6i+ controller card and four IBM 36GB 2.5&quot; 10K SCSI hot-swappable hard drives at A$779 each (you could go for 3.5&quot; drives or use Serial-ATA instead of SCSI but then you&apos;d only be able to use two hot-swappable bays; likewise you might be able to save some money by sourcing the drives from someone other than IBM, but I am not sure what sort of accessories IBM supplies with their drives to make them work with the hot-swap bays).</p>\n\n<p>The machine already comes with a power supply, needless to say, but if you want a hot-swappable spare you&apos;ll be up for another A$599.01 (possibly the most expensive power supply I&apos;ve ever seen). If you want some spare RAM online you can add A$779 for a gig of &quot;PC2-3200 ECC DDR SDRAM&quot;. I can&apos;t find an AUD price for the remote management card but on IBM&apos;s US website it says it goes for US$599.</p>\n\n<p>So it looks like the price tag on peace of mind is quite steep. I can&apos;t remember how much my old 305 system cost me but I think it was around the $3,000 mark whereas the configuration I propose here is in the neighbourhood of $10,000. Multiply that by two if you want a failover cluster (probably overkill). So like I said above, this little project will probably stay firmly in the realm of &quot;dreams&quot; and not &quot;action&quot; for some time yet...</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>There is a lot of misinformation on the net about the different types of open source licenses so I just wanted to offer some clarification. I am not a lawyer but I am fairly familiar with the major licenses.</p>\n\n<p>All licenses have two sides: freedoms and restrictions. In this discussion I won&apos;t delve too deeply into the monetary side of things (&quot;free&quot; as in beer) but will instead focus on the side of freedom (&quot;free&quot; as in liberty). In general it&apos;s that side which is the most important one to the people who came up with the major open source licenses (people like <a href=\"http://stallman.org/\">Richard Stallman</a>); the monetary &quot;freeness&quot; is just a secondary bonus, even if it is one of the key factors in the success and popularity of open source software.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000103more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>GPL and GPL-like licenses</h4>\n\n<p>The are two common misconceptions about the GPL. The first is that it is the &quot;most free&quot; of all open source licenses and the second is that the GPL says you&apos;re &quot;not allowed to make money&quot; from the software.</p>\n\n<h5>The &quot;most free&quot;</h5>\n\n<p>I often hear people (usually poorly informed Linux advocates) stating that the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\">GPL</a> is the &quot;most free&quot; of the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html\">open source licenses</a>. This is not true. </p>\n\n<p>The GPL grants you the freedom to do almost anything you want with the code, but it also imposes the key restriction that you cannot do anything which would prevent others from enjoying exactly the same freedoms. This is why you can&apos;t take GPL code and roll it into a commercial product (unless you release the source code for the product under the same terms) and why people like <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft&apos;s</a> <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/default.mspx\">Steve Ballmer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/default.asp\">Bill Gates</a> have mischaracterized the GPL as a form of <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/\">cancer</a> (and <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/20/gpl_pacman_will_eat_your/\">communism</a>, among other things).</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there&apos;s nothing cancerous about it. The GPL does not spread itself; <em>people</em> who wish to take the code spread it. The conditions of the GPL ensure that anyone who takes the code and wishes to redistribute it must allow others to enjoy the same freedoms. If you don&apos;t want your product to be &quot;contaminated&quot; with the GPL then all you need to do is refrain from taking the GPL code in the first place. Microsoft couldn&apos;t care less about &quot;cancer&quot;: the real reason they don&apos;t like the GPL is because they&apos;re worried that their own closed source software can&apos;t compete in the long term because it&apos;s not good enough (MS could learn a lot from <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/\">Apple</a>; Apple knows that the way to win in business is to make the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/\">best products</a> regardless of whether they be open or closed source).</p>\n\n<p>So this is near-total freedom with an important restriction that ensures that that freedom be ongoing. It is therefore not total freedom and it is not the &quot;most free&quot; of the open source licenses; on the other hand, it may well be the most ideologically pure of the free licenses because it embodies the most radical, politicized commitment to freedom.</p>\n\n<h5>&quot;You can&apos;t make money off the GPL&quot;</h5>\n\n<p>This is another common misconception. The GPL does <em>not</em> say that you can&apos;t sell software that is licensed under the GPL. What it <em>does</em> say is that if you redistribute GPL software (for example, offering it for download, modifying it or incorporating it into an existing product) then you must make the source code available under the same terms (the GPL license) for free or for a reasonable fee (such as the cost of the media and duplication).</p>\n\n<p>The license preamble is fairly clear about this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, you <em>can</em> take a GPL product (let&apos;s call it &quot;Linux Distro X&quot;) and repackage it and resell it (as &quot;Wincent Linux&quot;) and charge $1,000,000 for it. But because it&apos;s a GPL product you <em>must</em> also make the source available to those to whom you distribute the program, and you must do so for free or for a reasonable fee. </p>\n\n<p>The reason why GPL software tends to be financially free and not $1,000,000 is <em>not</em> because the license requires it but because two factors, competition and the fact that the source itself must be made available under the GPL, mean that there will always be a way to get it without paying for it. That drives the price down to &quot;free&quot; or at worst &quot;nearly free&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Companies like <a href=\"http://www.redhat.com/\">Red Hat</a> make a lot of money off Linux because they sell boxed copies of it with support. But thanks to the GPL they also distribute it for free and you can download it right off their servers even if you are not one of their customers. All the Linux vendors do this and this is why Linux is so extensively used.</p>\n\n<h4>BSD and BSD-like licenses</h4>\n\n<p>The BSD license is more free than the GPL because it doesn&apos;t impose that key restriction. Basically, the license says, &quot;you can do anything at all with this software, anything at all, as long as you preserve this copyright notice&quot;. That means you could take the code and roll it into a closed source product if you wanted and never give the code back to the community.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason it is &quot;more free&quot; than the GPL but less radical, less politicized. It is the Buddhist license of the open source world (and I say this only half-jokingly). It is more easily taken advantage of by commercial companies; it&apos;s well publicized that Microsoft&apos;s closed source Windows operating system contains BSD code, which is in perfect compliance with the license. The BSD license gives you more freedoms than the GPL but it does nothing to oblige you to provide those same freedoms to others.</p>\n\n<p>If you compare the licenses it&apos;s easy to see why you can take BSD code and release it under the GPL but you <em>cannot</em> take GPL code and release it under the BSD. The BSD basically gives you so much freedom that you can decide to limit the freedoms of others (if you&apos;re so inclined) but the GPL only gives you freedom up to the point where you cannot use it to limit the freedoms of others.</p>\n\n<h4>The public domain</h4>\n\n<p>The ultimate in freedom occurs when code is released into the public domain. When code is placed under the public domain the author usually says something like, &quot;I&apos;m putting this code in the public domain. You can do whatever you want with it.&quot; You can use such code without attribution and without preserving copyright notices (if there are any), you can roll it into closed source products, you can slap any license on it as you see fit. So it is freedom without restrictions.</p>\n\n<h4>The developer&apos;s perspective</h4>\n\n<p>As I said above, all licenses grant freedoms and impose restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>Commercial, close source licenses grant few freedoms and impose many restrictions. The GPL grants many freedoms but imposes a key restriction to protect those freedoms. The BSD grants total freedom, including the freedom to put an end to those freedoms, and the only restriction is that the original copyright notices be preserved. Code in the public domain is totally free, owned by no one, and you can do literally anything you want with it. Anything.</p>\n\n<p>As a small software developer I have released code under all of these licenses. If using code from another source I usually choose to preserve the licensing arrangements as put in place by the original author. For example, I released <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/\">WinSwitch</a> under the BSD license because that&apos;s the license that applied to the <a href=\"http://www.codingmonkeys.de/map/log/archives/000047.html\">original code</a> which I used as a basis. I have made so many additions and changes to that code that there are probably only a handful of lines that have survived from the original but I still feel that, ethically speaking, the right thing to do is contribute the code I&apos;ve written back to the community, seeing as &quot;the community&quot; gave something to me before. I could have changed the license (to the GPL, or to closed source, for example) but it just seemed right to preserve the spirit in which the code was originally released.</p>\n\n<p>When releasing code that&apos;s been written from scratch it&apos;s another ball game. My experiences have led me to believe that open source tends to only work when there is a large base of support in the community. To once again use the example of WinSwitch, no one has ever contributed a bugfix or other patch even though the source code has been downloaded many thousands of times; unless there is a large developer community then there are no real benefits to the open source model. I guess that shouldn&apos;t surprise anyone! If I am the only one writing code then of course it makes no difference if the code is readable by the public or not! Likewise, the donation rate is fairly abysmal: about 1 donation per 1,000 downloads, which means that the costs of distributing the software are much higher than the income it generates, and that is not even counting the time invested in writing and maintaining it. I guess I consider it as an advertisement; if it brings some people to my site and they then find out about my other (commercial) products then it might help in some small way to support the business and therefore enable me continue doing what I love doing.</p>\n\n<p>So I think that to work well open source requires either a large developer community (of volunteers) or corporate backing (companies willing to invest in the software, cover distribution costs and pay programmers to work on it). Linux is an obvious example of a project which has both the sizeable community and the corporate backing.</p>\n\n<p>As such, for small developers, I recommend using closed source licensing. Philosophically, I <em>like</em> open source, but I also know that if all my projects were open source I would be out of business; it just doesn&apos;t work for the small operator. I will continue to make some things available as open source because I like doing it, but I don&apos;t think it pays the bills. In these cases I favour the GPL because if I am making a considerable effort to make stuff available to others I don&apos;t want them taking that hard work and keeping it to themselves; they should have to provide the same to other people.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there are a lot of unscrupulous people out there that don&apos;t respect the GPL (<a href=\"http://drunkenblog.com/\">this weblog</a> has documented some notable cases); they simply absorb the code as if it were in public domain and try to make a profit from it. I suppose this is just another unedifying example of human nature to add to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2005/05/the_internet_a.php\">the long list</a> of cases that we see on the net almost every day...</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>From the very beginning I&apos;ve wanted <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/\">Synergy Advance</a> to be as modular as possible to maximize code reuse and make it easily extensible. The first thing I started by doing was splitting off code into reusable frameworks. The need to make the code reusable imposes a discipline that obliges you to think about writing a good API that will be useful in the general case. I now have a number of such frameworks: WODebug (the lowest-level framework), WOHotKey (hot key support), WOBezel (bezel windows), WOTest (unit testing) and WOBase (everything else, this is the most general of the frameworks). I&apos;ve already used some of these in my other products (like <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winhex/\">WinHex</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/\">WinSwitch</a>).</p>\n\n<p>At a design level it also means that I try to insulate things by using abstraction layers. Synergy Advance doesn&apos;t need to know that it&apos;s talking to iTunes, only that it&apos;s talking to a media player. This opens up the possibility of making Synergy Advance work with other players. Same goes for the iChat support; it&apos;s all done through abstraction layers.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of extensibility also means that plug-ins are important. They also make the code more maintainable because they keep the core functionality limited to a manageable size. Although in the preview releases so far I haven&apos;t split things up into too many pieces, at a source code level the program is very modular and ready to be split up.</p>\n\n<p>Today I did some refactoring that will make it easy for third-parties to write plug-ins to extend the functionality of Synergy Advance. Basically, I looked at some of the code in Synergy Advance itself and thought, this is the kind of code that could be directly useful to plug-in authors. So I took that code and split it off into a framework of its own, &quot;Synergy Advance.framework&quot;. Plug-in authors can write plug-ins that link against the framework and can perform common tasks without having to reinvent the wheel. The framework itself will most likely remain closed source, but I think I&apos;ll make the headers available to plug-in authors so they can get the benefit of the framework and link against it without having to do any reverse engineering.</p>\n\n<p>We&apos;ll see how this works when I put out the next public preview release (hopefully very soon, just wanting to tie up some lose ends on it before I put it out there). Basically I&apos;ll put some of the functionality into plug-ins to make sure the whole thing works.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000107more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

The line numbers are subject to change, of course, but here is the excerpt as it currently stands:</p>\n\n<pre>- (NSString *)synergydName\n{\n    return [WO_SYNERGYD_NAME stringByAppendingPathExtension:@&quot;app&quot;];\n}</pre>\n\n<p>Well, as you may have guessed, this entry is a bit of a joke. That code in itself isn&apos;t very useful and it won&apos;t compile because it&apos;s missing a macro definition and some context. But I post it here for three reasons: (1) It&apos;s Sunday and I&apos;m a little bored; (2) Because I love short methods (they&apos;re much easier to maintain); and (3) Because it&apos;s interesting that the controller is such a long source file.</p>\n\n<p>At the moment the whole file is nearly 6,000 lines long. This is one hell of a controller class. Just think how long it would be if it weren&apos;t for <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaBindings/CocoaBindings.html\">Cocoa Bindings</a> (probably twice as long and twice as ugly).</p>\n\n<p>I generally favour breaking things up into smaller, more manageable units. I like small, simple classes that do one job and do it well (the implementation of my iChat controller class, for example, is only 177 lines long). But the truth is that the main controller doesn&apos;t really lend itself to being broken up into smaller units. I could split some functionality into categories in separate files but that wouldn&apos;t really change the fact that the class as a whole is one logical unit.</p>\n\n<p>But it&apos;s not really as bad as it sounds. 2,000 of those lines are accessor methods, all of which were generated using <a href=\"http://www.kevincallahan.org/software/accessorizer.html\">Accessorizer</a>. Yes, the class has <em>a lot</em> of instance variables, but creating the accessors for them was relatively painless.</p>\n\n<p>You can subtract another few hundred lines for defines, constant declarations and other such stuff which isn&apos;t really code in the sense that it doesn&apos;t actually execute, it&apos;s just there to support the rest of the class.</p>\n\n<p>Really, the bulk of the file comes from the fact that Synergy Advance can do a lot of things. If your menu contains a hundred menu items that do a hundred different things then you&apos;ve got to write the code that implements those things somewhere. Sure, you can write general methods that you reuse whenever possible, but there&apos;s only so much coding that can be avoided by pointing, clicking, and hooking-up in Interface Builder.</p>\n\n<p>[Ironically: I later got rid of the method which I used to open this post.]</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000108more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>I just had one of those nice moments where you write some code and you know straight away that you&apos;ve done the right thing. These moments usually follow a period of doubt, then something slips into place and you realize that you&apos;ve found the correct solution.</p>\n\n<p>In this case I was writing an Objective-C wrapper for some sysctl(3) stuff. I like to write wrappers around Carbon, POSIX and Mach stuff so that my Objective-C source code looks nice and is easy to maintain. I find it very distracting when I have to mix together procedural C code with Objective-C message sending; in fact, it starts to look decidedly ugly to me, especially in the case of the Carbon API.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I don&apos;t want to sound irrational or prejudiced about this. I think good old-fashioned C code that does nothing but call POSIX or Standard C Library stuff can look pretty attractive in a lean, utilitarian kind of way. Objective-C, especially the Cocoa variety, can look decidedly elegant. Carbon pretty much always looks ugly to me because so often it requires you to pass variables by reference which then become recipients for your return values; I much prefer the way most Objective-C methods give you a single return value, they don&apos;t require you to pass things by reference, and they flag error conditions either with simple BOOL return values or by raising (catchable, well-documented) exceptions. Regardless of which approach might be your favorite, most would agree that mixing these different coding philosophies together almost always <em>looks</em> horrible. Best to keep things consistent and keep blocks of like code together.</p>\n\n<p>So I like to wrap up that ugliness and encapsulate it inside an Objective-C interface. Once it&apos;s wrapped up I never have to look at it again and my source remains nice and clean and easy to maintain. Using all these different APIs is somewhat of a necessary evil too, because there is a lot that Cocoa just can&apos;t do and probably never will be able to either.</p>\n\n<p>So anyway, I had my sysctl wrapper up and working and I was happy that it allowed me to encapsulate away some of the ugliness that I&apos;d otherwise have to sprinkle throughout my Objective-C source, but I felt uncomfortable about it. I knew that wrapping up the sysctl API was at least grouping a related set of functions together into a single logical unit, but it still didn&apos;t feel right. It was still slightly arbitrary; <em>group these together because that&apos;s the way they&apos;re grouped at the POSIX level</em>. But I wasn&apos;t working at the POSIX level, I was wanting to work at the Cocoa level. The Cocoa way would be to group things together according to their purpose, not their underlying implementation details. And although I&apos;d been able to abstract away some of the nasty details of the API, I was still having to deal with the unsavory aftertaste of dealing with POSIX and Carbon return types that were returned by my wrapper.</p>\n\n<p>In the end I realized that I could have my cake and eat it too. The sysctl wrapper gives me an Objective-C interface to a very low-level API, and I&apos;ve taken advantage of that API in a number of other high-level classes and categories. The categories are where the code feels most &quot;right&quot;; because it&apos;s where I&apos;ve been able to fill in some of the holes in Apple&apos;s methods with methods of my own, faithful to their style and conventions, but leveraging the power of the (now-encapsulated and hidden) lower-level API. Rather than providing methods to do anything you could possibly imagine, I provide methods to provide the thing you&apos;re most likely to actually want to do (which <em>in theory</em> is what Apple does as well). In the places where I need more control I can talk directly to the wrapper; but in almost all other cases I can just talk to my category-augmented versions of old Cocoa favorites like NSWorkspace and friends. As soon as I did it it felt &quot;right&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>You might doubt that so many levels of abstraction are a good thing (programmer calls a category, category makes use of a wrapper class, wrapper class accesses yet-another, lower-level API; and within those layers there are sometimes additional levels of message-forwarding in methods that have been (re)factored to maximise code reuse) but in many cases this is exactly what is happening inside Apple&apos;s Frameworks. A lot of the stuff we access via Cocoa is really just something that rests on top of the Carbon, POSIX or Mach layers. Furthermore, the code I&apos;m talking about here is infrequently called and unlikely ever to become a bottleneck. The levels of abstraction do not slow things down as far as the user is concerned, but for the programmer they make the code easier to read and more maintainable which means that it gets written faster, works better, and is less likely to have bugs.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000110more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Since <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2005/07/synergy_advance_1.php\">my post the other day</a> about my monstrously large main controller class I&apos;ve been working hard on adding new features to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/\">Synergy Advance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But working on a large body of code is like moulding pottery from clay: even as you go along adding new bits you continue to work with the already-existing clay, moulding it, reforming it, smoothing it and so on. In programming parlance this translates to a lot of refactoring.</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve been quite satisfied to see that even though I&apos;ve been <em>adding</em> new features to the software the controller has been getting <em>smaller</em> as I go along. The truth is that Xcode 2.1 is pretty zippy and doesn&apos;t have too much trouble even with a 6,000 line source file, but there <em>is</em> a noticeable lag when it comes to saving, and saving is something I do often (hitting Command-S at the end of every line is a reflex for me, bred in by years of working with unreliable computers and software!).</p>\n\n<p>Some of the refactoring is just moving source to different places (to where it should be) and some of it is folding oft-used functionality into somewhere that it can be re-used with minimal code duplication (real refactoring), but either way the end result is a more manageable and maintainable codebase.</p>\n\n<p>Today I&apos;ve added in a bunch of Growl functionality and Cocoa Bindings have made writing the preferences code much simpler. And while doing this I&apos;ve spotted some nice fault lines where I can logically split functionality from the controller off into a category. I&apos;ve also spotted a way in which I can move a huge number of instance variables (which are just used to cache frequently accessed information) out of the controller class and into a proxy class (not an NSProxy but a proxy in layperson&apos;s sense) in the SynergyAdvance.framework. Straight away I&apos;ll have hacked 2,000 lines off of the controller (all those accessor methods) and put them somewhere where they won&apos;t get in the way, and I&apos;ll have the benefit of moving some more useful functionality into the framework where it can be used by plug-ins. Basically I&apos;ve got this abstraction layer between the Synergy Advance core and iTunes, so that Synergy Advance doesn&apos;t really need to know that it&apos;s talking to iTunes, only that it&apos;s talking to &quot;a player&quot;; I&apos;m now formally separating that abstraction layer out into a different class and sticking it in the framework. And by ejecting that cached data from the controller class I&apos;m keeping things truer to the hallowed &quot;MVC&quot; paradigm.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000113more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>As you learn Objective-C you&apos;ll come across lots of advice about <em>how</em>, <em>when</em> and <em>why</em> to write accessor methods and you&apos;ll see many, many different ways of writing them.</p>\n\n<p>The answer to the &quot;when&quot; question is easy, especially now that we have <a href=\"http://www.kevincallahan.org/software/accessorizer.html\">Accessorizer</a>: <em>Always</em>. Always write accessors. In the old days writing accessors was time consuming and even if you wanted to come up with a set of preprocessor macros to use as shortcuts it still made sense to be selective about when you wrote accessors. Now it&apos;s just too easy: select a slab of instance variables and let Accessorizer do the work. </p>\n\n<p>The answer to the &quot;why&quot; question is simple: <em>Just trust me</em>. Seeing as writing accessors is easy, just take my word for it and go about your business; sooner or later you&apos;ll find yourself in a situation where you&apos;ll have a revelation. You&apos;ll say to yourself, &quot;Wow, that refactoring I just did was so easy because I had those accessor methods; would&apos;ve been hell without it&quot;, or, &quot;Man, I&apos;m glad I had those threadsafe accessor methods; it&apos;s made it so easy to start using these classes without having to think too much about threadsafety issues&quot;, or, &quot;Gee, those accessor methods have sure made it easy to throw stuff around in my Model-View-Controller object diagram&quot;, and so forth. Once you&apos;ve had a few of these experiences you&apos;ll never question the &quot;why&quot; of writing accessors again.</p>\n\n<p>The &quot;how&quot; question is the most difficult. Once I&apos;d learned the <a href=\"http://www.stepwise.com/Articles/Technical/2001-03-11.01.html\">Cocoa memory management</a> paradigm I still found myself asking, &quot;So what&apos;s <em>the</em> best way to write an accessor?&quot;. I wanted to get past the 5, 10 or 15 different ways I&apos;d seen of writing accessors to the one, <em>best</em> way of writing them.</p>\n\n<p>There are lots of articles on how to write accessors and I won&apos;t rehash them here (examples: <a href=\"http://www.stepwise.com/Articles/Technical/2002-06-11.01.html\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stepwise.com/Articles/Technical/MemoryManagement.html\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://nslog.com/archives/2003/05/05/accessor_methods.php\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://nslog.com/archives/2003/05/17/accessor_methods_part_2.php\">here</a>), but the key lesson is <strong>there is no single <em>best</em> way to write accessors</strong>. Hmmm. Perhaps I can phrase that more positively: instead of searching for the holy grail of accessors, always choose the right accessor for the job.</p>\n\n<p>Things to bear in mind when choosing an accessor for &quot;the job&quot;:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>How important is performance for this accessor (how often will it be called)?</em> An accessor that&apos;s called 200 times per second (or 2000) has different design requirements than one called once every five minutes.</li>\n  <li><em>How important is thread safety for this accessor?</em> If it&apos;s important then you&apos;ll have to worry more about synchronization, locks and the persistence (or otherwise) of autoreleased objects.</li>\n  <li><em>Will this be a long-lived instance variable or a short-lived one?</em> The kind of accessor you&apos;ll write for an instance variable that is set at program launch and exists for the lifetime of the program will be very different from the kind you&apos;d write for an instance variable that changes more often or less predictably.</li>\n  <li><em>Is this a collection or a non-collection instance variable?</em> And if it&apos;s a collection object, do you want a copy of the contents or will you mostly be focussed on adding/removing objects to/from it?</li>\n  <li><em>Do I care more about the specific instance of this variable or its contents?</em> And relatedly, if you care about a specific instance of the variable, where else in the program is it likely to be used?</li>\n  <li><em>How likely is it that this accessor will be used to re-set the same value?</em> Should you be testing for pointer equality before trying to re-set things?</li>\n  <li><em>Will this class belong to a reusable, general framework?</em> If so, you should probably be more conservative in your design because you have no way of knowing in what kinds of situations your accessor will be called.</li>\n  <li><em>Is this class highly customized, specific and unlikely to be reused?</em> In a controlled situation you don&apos;t have to worry so much about the general case and you therefore it&apos;s not so important to be conservative in your design; you can use exactly the right accessor for the job.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div id=\"a000114more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>I just got hold of a Gefen <a href=\"http://www.gefen.com/kvm/product.jsp?prod_id=2950\">DVI DL Switcher</a> KVM today and wanted to post a recommendation. Gefen definitely don&apos;t make the cheapest KVMs out there but they could well make the best ones.</p>\n\n<p>The &quot;DL&quot; in the name stands for &quot;Dual Link&quot;. It&apos;s the only consumer KVM on the market today that can drive a dual link DVI display like Apple&apos;s 30&quot; Cinema Display. Their <a href=\"http://www.gefen.com/kvm/product.jsp?prod_id=2949\">SL (Single Link) product</a> is about $100 cheaper for those who don&apos;t need or want the extra capacity. I originally intended to purchase the SL but it wasn&apos;t in stock and the DL model was, so I decided to invest the extra money knowing I&apos;d be able to extract the benefit when my glorious 30&quot;-owning days materialize at some point in the future.</p>\n\n<p>I was forced to become a KVM expert a few days ago when I started thinking about the imminent arrival of the Developer Transition Kit that I am effectively renting from Apple. I don&apos;t have the money for a new monitor and the truth is I don&apos;t have the space either. I had three options: (1) Control the machine remotely using Apple Remote Desktop or VNC; (2) Plug and unplug the monitor, mouse and keyboard whenever I wanted to use the Intel machine; or (3) Get a KVM. The third option seemed to make the best long term sense; even after I&apos;ve returned the kit to Apple I can think of lots of uses for a KVM.</p>\n\n<p>A friend of mine with a lot of KVM experience recommend I check out the Belkin KVMs. The problem is that no DVI-equipped Belkin product can exceed a resolution of 1600 by 1200. Same for the Iogear KVMs; 1600 by 1200 is the limit. If you have a larger monitor you can either turn down your resolution (which for obvious reasons isn&apos;t really an acceptable option) or you can get a non-DVI switch, but then you&apos;re degrading the video signal by introducing an additional digital-analog-digital conversion (for me that wasn&apos;t an acceptable option either). We pay a lot of money for our monitors and graphics cards nowadays; I don&apos;t want anything getting in the way and degrading the quality of the experience.</p>\n\n<p>Finally I found <a href=\"http://www.gefen.com/\">Gefen</a>. Gefen has been in the game for a long, long time. I remember seeing full-page glossy ads from them in computer magazines back in those pre-Internet days when I used to actually buy printed material. The units aren&apos;t cheap but they&apos;ve got an excellent reputation for quality and an outstanding feature set. Even their SL (Single Link) DVI Switcher breaks the 1600 by 1200 barrier without ever leaving the digital realm, so it should be of Interest to anyone who owns a large monitor like the Apple 23&quot; Cinema Display.</p>\n\n<p>The product is heavy, metallic, robust, rack-mountable. Looks like it could withstand quite a beating. Comes with high quality USB and DVI cables (and of less interest to me, audio cables and an IR remote control). The unit features an integrated USB 2.0 hub (plug in <em>one</em> USB lead from each computer and the KVM provides you with <em>two</em> outputs). Most importantly of all, it has a cool blue LED on the front of the unit. The power transformer takes a standard triphase computer power lead which means that I could plug it into a spare port on the back of my UPS; this was a welcome surprise because I was expecting it would use a hard-to-adapt wall plug and that I&apos;d have to get a custom adaptor made up to plug it into the UPS. I&apos;m pleased to report that the UPS handles the load of two machines, a monitor and the KVM without a complaint.</p>\n\n<p>The unit works very well, no degradation of the video signal, keyboard and mouse work perfectly, and the switch time is snappy enough (anywhere between half a second and a couple seconds depending on whether the &quot;other&quot; machine has put the display to sleep in the meantime). For me KVMs belong to the same class of devices as UPSs: it&apos;s the class of devices where &quot;cheap&quot; shouldn&apos;t be too high up your list of criteria. Spend a little extra for quality and you won&apos;t regret it; go too cheap and you could well lament the purchase later on.</p>\n\n<p>All in all I think the product is worthy of a hearty recommendation. The Gefen customer service was great too, along with that of their distributor in Spain, <a href=\"http://www.videodigital.es/\">Video Digital</a>.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000118more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Donald Knuth famously <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth\">said</a> &quot;premature optimization is the root of all evil&quot;. You can waste a lot of time optimizing code for negligible benefit. You can also waste your resources by optimizing the wrong thing; you generally can&apos;t be sure of where the bottlenecks will be until the entire project is done or at least near to completion.</p>\n\n<p>Computers are getting faster and faster all the time. Often when I have to make a choice between fast code and readable code I choose the latter. Ideally you&apos;ll write code that is both fast <em>and</em> readable but other times you are forced to make a choice. Customers care most about features and products that actually make it out the door; write maintainable code and you&apos;ll be able to produce more of it, and your customers will be happier. If you decide that it&apos;s worth sacrificing 1% of speed in order to get 50% more features then most of your users will agree with you.</p>\n\n<p>This doesn&apos;t mean you can throw efficiency concerns out the window. When you see an opportunity to make something faster without losing maintainability you should take it, especially if it&apos;s an easy change to make. It&apos;s good to get in the habit of writing code that executes quickly.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday I had a situation where I did have to do some optimization. <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/\">Synergy Advance</a> has the ability to do some fancy stuff with the Dock icon. But I found that compositing a non-trival amount of stuff multiple times per second was using over 40% of one CPU. Ouch. Turn off the bells and whistles and CPU usage dropped back down below 1% again. But I like bells and whistles. After optimization it was using less than 1% of one CPU even with everything turned on. A case of optimization the even Knuth would agree with.</p>\n\n<h4>Plug-ins</h4>\n\n<p>From the very beginning I&apos;ve wanted Synergy Advance to take advantage of plug-ins so that it could be flexibly extended in a way that the original Synergy cannot. Everything is highly modular. Even where stuff is compiled into the main, monolithic executable it still has a relatively independent existence within the class hierarchy (which means that I can easily move stuff from the main executable into plug-ins or frameworks). There are five base frameworks that I&apos;ve created and which I also use in other products. I&apos;ve split off a large part of the functionality of Synergy Advance into a special framework of its own so that plug-ins can link against it and get that functionality for free. All of the preference panes are completely separate modules (with separate Xcode project files) which build independently and which encapsulate a lot of the voluminous &quot;glue code&quot; that comes with complicated user interfaces.</p>\n\n<p>Today I thought I would eat my own dog food as far as plug-ins goes. The iTunes communication engine, which was already neatly tucked away under an abstraction layer, was recently moved into the SynergyAdvance.framework. Today I went a step further and broke it out into a plug-in of its own. I&apos;m about to do the same with the iChat engine. Basically the groundwork was already laid from a design point of view; I just had to do the physical redistribution of the code and massage it to make it compile and run correctly at its new location. The potential to use Synergy Advance with other players and other instant messaging clients is most definitely open.</p>\n\n<p>The only bad choice I made at the start and which I am only just now coming to regret is that the word &quot;iTunes&quot; is hardcoded in the strings files at a lot of places. Changing that is going to be a time consuming and monotonous chore, but one that&apos;s probably better done sooner rather than later...</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000123more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Every now and again I come up against an infuriating Cocoa bug. Today I&apos;ve just spent a few hours struggling against one in particular. It could be that it&apos;s a bug or it could be &quot;intended behaviour&quot; (sigh). It&apos;s days like these that I don&apos;t like my job...</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000124more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>The problem</h4>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve been working on Dock icon stuff for <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/\">Synergy Advance</a>. You can do a number of things such as animate the Dock icon, show a progress indicator, show cover art, show the cover art as a badge, and so forth. Because the settings are independent of one another you can turn on none, one, or <a href=\"http://us.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/dock-icon-preview3.png\">more than one of them at a time</a>. This means that sometimes I have to composite more than one thing into an NSImage.</p>\n\n<p>I was doing this using the <code>lockFocus</code> and <code>unlockFocus</code> methods of NSImage and drawing directly into the image. I have a number of utility methods that perform the compositing which have prototypes like this:</p>\n\n<pre>+ (NSImage *)imageWithIcon:(NSImage *)anIcon badge:(NSImage *)aBadge</pre>\n\n<p>The idea is that you pass in an icon, a badge, and get back a shiny new icon with a badge on it. Inside the method I make a <code>copy</code> of the icon and do my drawing into that, returning the copy; it would be bad manners, after all, to change the image that was passed as a parameter the method.</p>\n\n<p>This all worked fine but I found that if I performed multiple composites in stages then only the final stage was working. The first thing I suspected was a bug in my own code. After a couple hours of very frustrating trouble shooting (head-scratching, log-statement-peppering, debugging, file-writing, file-reading, visually-inspecting) I was able to confirm that my own code was correct and that Cocoa was discarding the first composite operation and keeping only the second.</p>\n\n<h4>The question is, &quot;Why?&quot;</h4>\n\n<p>Why might Cocoa do this? I guess my understanding of Cocoa&apos;s NSImage system in general and the <code>lockFocus</code> call in particular is inadequate. Either that, or there&apos;s a bug in there.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>lockFocus</code> documentation talks about &quot;setting the offscreen window (where the receiver&apos;s representation is cached) as the current window&quot;. I took that to mean that you&apos;re drawing into a window somewhere but you&apos;re also permanently altering the &quot;receiver&apos;s representation&quot;. If <code>lockFocus</code> isn&apos;t appropriate for permanently altering an NSImage then why is it used so frequently in the Apple sample code?</p>\n\n<p>It would seem that I was interpreting the documentation too liberally; when it talks about the representation being &quot;cached&quot; I think it literally means that you&apos;re only altering the cached copy, not the actual receiver itself.</p>\n\n<p>What this actually means is that when you do something like this to an icon which has already been the target of a compositing operation:</p>\n\n<pre>NSImage *image = [[anIcon copy] autorelease];</pre>\n\n<p>You are not getting a copy of the composited icon, you&apos;re getting a copy of the icon before any compositing took place. This is definitely not what I expected. A quick experiment:</p>\n\n<pre>NSImage *image = anIcon;</pre>\n\n<p>If you forget the copy then you can do as many compositing phases as you like and none of them will be mysteriously discarded. Of course, you can&apos;t work like this because you&apos;re changing the source image that was passed to you as a parameter and that&apos;s a bad thing. Another test:</p>\n\n<pre>NSImage *image = [[[NSImage alloc] initWithData:\n    [anIcon TIFFRepresentation]] autorelease];</pre>\n\n<p>Lo and behold: requesting a TIFF representation of the image preserves your previous compositing operations. So if <code>lockFocus</code> only operates on a cached representation of the receiver then <code>TIFFRepresentation</code> forces the receiver to promote whatever is in the cache to &quot;permanent&quot; status. This strikes me as a little inconsistent. I think that if <code>TIFFRepresentation</code> does it then <code>copy</code> should as well.</p>\n\n<p>There&apos;s only one problem with the <code>TIFFRepresentation</code> approach: it is slow and CPU intensive. This is the solution I finally came up with and it is much quicker and CPU-friendly:</p>\n\n<pre>NSImage *image = [[[NSImage alloc] initWithSize:iconSize] autorelease];\nNSImageRep *rep = [[anIcon bestRepresentationForDevice:nil] copy];\n[image addRepresentation:rep];\n[rep release];</pre>\n\n<p>NSImageReps cannot be shared between NSImages but they do conform to the <code>NSCopying</code> protocol so I create a new blank image and copy the NSImageRep. The copied NSImageRep does indeed preserve previous composite operations.</p>\n\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n\n<p><code>lockFocus</code> is used in a lot of Apple sample code to demonstrate manipulation of NSImages. It&apos;s only now that I realise why the sample code tends not to <code>copy</code> the source image as a starting point. In the sample code Apple usually starts with a completely blank image, locks focus on it, and then composites the original image into the blank image as a starting point. To me it seems logical that if you want a copy of an image that you should send it a <code>copy</code> message; in the real world, however, if you want a copy of an image you need to composite it into a new image... Although it seems much less intuitive and somewhat more convoluted (as well as requiring more messages) this other alternative should work just as well as the NSImageRep <code>copy</code> that I employ above. I don&apos;t know how optimized the Apple <code>compositeToPoint:operation:</code> method is, but I would like to think that the difference in speed between it and a straight <code>copy</code> call shouldn&apos;t be too large.</p>\n</div></div>",

There are submenus for Playlists, Genres and Artists. If your library has 50,000 songs in it then the submenu showing the library playlist alone will contain 50,000 menu items (and all of those items will appear in the Artists and Genres submenus too at various places). It&apos;s easy to see how this could get out of control. Furthermore, Cocoa won&apos;t allow you to use the same NSMenuItem in different NSMenus (at least the documentation tells you not to do it!) so if you want the same item to appear at multiple places in the menu hierarchy then you need to make a brand new copy of it for each place where you want it included.</p>\n\n<p>So far this hasn&apos;t been a problem in my local testing, but then again I am working with a measly 2,040 songs in my library. But the next version of Synergy Advance is going to include something that is going to necessitate a change: (optional) graphics in the menus. We&apos;ll no longer be talking about 5,000 or 10,000 or even 100,000 tiny snippets of text. Suddenly we&apos;ll be talking about a lot of graphics. A load of them.

Since the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2005/06/synergy_and_syn.php\">problems in June</a> I&apos;ve wanted to accelerate my plans to move to different hardware, but it&apos;s difficult because I am in Spain and the hardware is in Australia. On Thursday night the server stopped responding and wouldn&apos;t reboot, so since then I&apos;ve been doing my best to migrate things to a new server in the USA.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the incident could not have come at a worse time. The server went down only a few hours after I announced a new version of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/\">Synergy</a>, provisioning the new server was delayed because of time zone differences, contracts and international faxes flowing back and forth, the new server runs Linux and the old one ran FreeBSD and all the software is different so the migration has been very difficult. Furthermore, in about 5 hours from now I am off to the airport to fly to Australia; the journey itself will last about 30 hours.</p>\n\n<p>So as an end user, what does this mean for you? Firstly, that there are still a lot of broken links on the site; secondly, that some areas are not yet migrated to the new machine (for example, the forums do not yet work); thirdly, that many of the automated systems are down (so I have to process payments manually). On the bright side, you should also notice that the site is much, much quicker, but for at least the next few days it will still be in transition mode. Thanks for your understanding and patience, and please accept my apologies for the inconvenience.

The diagonal red lines show the steadily growing uptime for the old server which ran FreeBSD. The blue line shows the new server which is hosted by <a href=\"http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=30735717&amp;siteid=41506187&amp;bfpage=hosting_headaches\" target=\"_top\">Rackspace</a> and runs <a href=\"http://www.redhat.com/\">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the graph you can see a number of reboots of the FreeBSD system, almost all of them required after updating the operating system with security patches which required a reboot. You&apos;ll also see an impressive uptime of in excess of 400 days at one point. Not bad for a production system on a busy website. I was able to achieve that uptime by conservative system administration (subscribing to security alert mailing lists, applying workarounds immediately, and minimizing changes and unnecessary upgrades to the server). Whenever a security issue popped up which required an upgrade of the kernel or the entire operating system I bit the bullet and performed the upgrade as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n<p>The last two red lines are of interest. These are the only involuntary reboots that you see on the graph. The second to last line corresponds to a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2005/06/synergy_and_syn.php\">server crash in June</a> where the filesystem got corrupted; it was in such an inconsistent state that it wouldn&apos;t reboot when power-cycled. Given the reliability of the software on the system I suspected a faulty hard disk. Unfortunately, the server was on the other side of the world from me, so I had to pay a consultant to fsck the filesystem and I could only hope that it would keep working until I got back to Australia to investigate the problem more thoroughly. It didn&apos;t.</p>\n\n<p>The last red line shows another period which came to an end with <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2005/08/new_server_brok.php\">another server crash</a>. I suspected that the same dodgy hard disk was the culprit. I just couldn&apos;t stomach the idea of paying $185/hour consultants to get the machine booting again, so I made the jump to <a href=\"http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=30735717&amp;siteid=41506187&amp;bfpage=hosting_headaches\">Rackspace</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=30735717&amp;siteid=41506187&amp;bfpage=hosting_headaches\">Rackspace</a> is one of the most expensive managed hosting companies around but it is also one of the best; in fact, I would argue that it is <em>the</em> best. Not only do they look after hardware faults like the one I had within an hour, they also take care of restoring things from backup, provide incredible support, and deliver the fastest and most reliable connection to the network that you can find. <a href=\"http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=30735717&amp;siteid=41506187&amp;bfpage=hosting_headaches\">Rackspace</a> has <a href=\"http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2005/11/07/datapipe_rackspace_and_interland_most_reliable_hosters_in_october_2005.html\">yet again</a> been ranked the most reliable web host in the latest Netcraft survey (October 2005). <a href=\"http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=30735717&amp;siteid=41506187&amp;bfpage=hosting_headaches\">Rackspace</a> consistently ranks in the top ten, taking the top slot more often than not.</p>\n\n<p>I don&apos;t know how often I&apos;ll be rebooting that server now that I&apos;m running Red Hat, but one thing you can already see from the graph is the incredible solidity of the connection provided by <a href=\"http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=30735717&amp;siteid=41506187&amp;bfpage=hosting_headaches\">Rackspace</a>. Notice how the red (FreeBSD) lines break up in some places; I can only presume that this is because my then-ISP in Australia couldn&apos;t deliver the same kind of network reliability that <a href=\"http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=30735717&amp;siteid=41506187&amp;bfpage=hosting_headaches\">Rackspace</a> does.

Previously it was possible to make such binaries but it required some fiddling. You had to produce two binaries and then stitch them together into a single one.

    "html": "<p>Not sure when this happened, but somewhere along the road to Mac OS X 10.4.3 Spotlight got a whole lot better.</p>\n\n<p>First thing I noticed when I upgraded to 10.4.3 is that it got much, much faster. I actually can use it as an app launcher now (previously it was almost always quicker to switch to the Finder, navigate to the Applications folder, and double-click on the app you wanted to launch).</p>\n\n<p>The second thing, and one I only just noticed today, is that Apple has removed the brain-dead implicit exclusion of certain paths on the hard drive. In 10.4, for example, Spotlight didn&apos;t index the &quot;/Developer/&quot; folder. If you wanted to find documentation you had to search from within Xcode. If you wanted to find a header file, say, &quot;/usr/include/objc-runtime.h&quot;, you would have to navigate to it manually in the Terminal because if you searched in the Finder you&apos;d get no results.</p>\n\n<p>Well, I now see that typing &quot;objc-runtime&quot; in the Finder or in the Spotlight menu bar interface results in the desired file being found, as well as the variants of it in the various SDKs installed in &quot;/Developer/SDKs/&quot;. And despite the fact that Spotlight is now indexing more and returning more search results, it seems to be doing it all much faster than before. Well done, Apple. Spotlight is actually starting to fulfill its promise.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000149more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

After months without a single false positive or other problem I&apos;ve set up a procmail recipe that deletes virus-bearing messages as soon as they hit the server. That should put an end to my father&apos;s complaints about the amount of time he spends downloading emails laden with viruses over his very slow dialup connection. He was getting about 15 virus-bearing emails a day, most of them identified by ClamAV as &quot;Worm.Sober.U&quot;, so this change should make a considerable difference to the amount of time it takes him to download his email.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000153more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Ok. So when I started work on <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> I decided to raise the bar on the minimum required OS version to Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther). It just made things easier to drop Jaguar (10.2) support and it allowed me to use delicious new technologies like <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaBindings/CocoaBindings.html\">Cocoa Bindings</a>. In the meantime I&apos;ve continued to support Jaguar in <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">Synergy</a> even though it&apos;s caused some difficulties along the way.</p>\n\n<p>Well, when Tiger came along I decided that I would keep my Panther support in place in Synergy Advance but add some extra functionality when the app was launched on Tiger. The trouble that I&apos;m currently facing is that the divide between what can be done in the two versions of the OS is just getting too wide, and one of the major problems is <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/macosx/coredata.html\">Core Data</a>. It&apos;s just too damn powerful, and I can do too many things with it that I can&apos;t even contemplate trying to replicate them on Panther.</p>\n\n<p>So now I&apos;m looking at doing a little bit more than just <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2002/tn2064.html\">weak linking</a> (<a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Concepts/WeakLinking.html\">see also</a>) a few symbols. We are talking about a central pillar being present on Tiger but not there at all on Panther, and it is going to have repercussions all over the code base. This is going to create a major gap between what Synergy Advance can do on 10.3 and what it can do on 10.4. It&apos;s awfully tempting to just drop Panther support, but I&apos;m going to grit my teeth and see if I can solider on without the workload of maintaining what are effectively two separate code bases getting too large.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000162more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

First up, <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=83096173&amp;s=143454&amp;i=83096114\"><em>Es por t&#xED;</em>, by Grupo Mamey</a>, which is a 2003 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachata\">bachata</a> remake of the <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=13433542&amp;s=143454&amp;i=13599733\">original by Juanes</a> (which I also purchased). The song features the breath-takingly honest and direct romantic lyrics that are a Juanes trademark:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Cada vez que me levanto y veo que a mi lado est&#xE1;s me siento renovado<br>\ntus ojos me llevan lentamente al Sol<br>\ny tu boca me habla del amor y el coraz&#xF3;n<br>\ntu piel tiene el color de un rojo atardecer<br>\ny es por t&#xED; que late mi coraz&#xF3;n<br>\ny es por t&#xED; que he vuelto a hablar de amor<br>\ny es por t&#xED; que brillan mis ojos hoy<br>\ny es por t&#xED; que calma mi dolor</blockquote>\n\n<p>There&apos;s something so brutally honest about the Juanes lyrics, the manner in which he lays bare his feelings and makes himself totally vulnerable which is touching. These are lyrics which can take you back in time to a period in which you had never been hurt, in which your faith in love was unshaken; it&apos;s nice to listen to this music and at least consider that one day it might be possible to have that kind of faith again, that willingness to recognise that you might get hurt but that &quot;vale la pena&quot;. These lyrics ring true in Spanish, &quot;llegan al alma&quot;, but translated into English they just don&apos;t sound right because I can&apos;t imagine any English singer ever uttering such words.</p>\n\n<p>Then there were the 2004 versions of <em>Ven, dev&#xF3;rame otra vez</em> by <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=78745046&amp;s=143454&amp;i=78745011\">Charlie Cruz</a> and <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=31102657&amp;s=143454&amp;i=31102816\">Lalo Rodr&#xED;guez</a>; finally I opted for <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=74432464&amp;s=143454&amp;i=74432387\"><em>Yo soy la candela</em> by Frank River</a>. These last three were all purchased because they are salsa numbers that I&apos;ve heard enough times in the clubs around here that they&apos;ve started to grow on me.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>In June last year I ordered a Developer Transition Kit (DTK). The idea is that you paid Apple $999 and they sent you an Intel-based Mac you could use for development and testing. The market value of the machine must have been way over $999 but the catch was that you&apos;d have to return the unit to Apple before the end of 2006. In other words, you were effectively renting the machine, not purchasing it.</p>\n\n<p>I figured this was a fair enough deal. After all, when you purchase a Mac for, say, $2,000, and you sell it a year and a half later for $1,000 you&apos;ve effectively invested $1,000 in &quot;renting&quot; the machine for 18 months. This is the way buying and selling computers works. And having the DTK has allowed me to get my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/\">products</a> converted to Universal Binaries in time for the release of their first Intel-based machines.</p>\n\n<p>Well, today Apple announced their <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/dtkexchange/index.html\">DTK Exchange Program</a>. In short, you return your DTK to Apple and they give you one of the new Intel-based <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/imac/\">iMacs</a>. Yes, they <em>give</em> it to you (or sell it, if you want to look at it that way). From the <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/dtkexchange/faq.html\">FAQ</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><strong>5. Will I own the iMac received via the DTK Exchange Program?</strong><br>\nYes. The Hardware Purchase Agreement Terms and Conditions apply to the iMac received via the DTK Exchange Program.</blockquote>\n\n<p>So my $999 &quot;rental&quot; of the DTK has turned into a 6-month rental of a DTK with a free iMac thrown in! A similarly specced iMac bought from the Apple store would cost you about $1,299. And check this out:</p>\n\n<blockquote><strong>8. Do I have to pay for shipping costs?</strong><br>\nApple will pay for the shipment of the exchange system as well as the return of the DTK to Apple.</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&apos;s something that really matters to me, seeing as I live in Spain and shipping either of the machines would prove to be quite a costly exercise. Talk about acting in good faith... Let it not be said that Apple doesn&apos;t treat its developers well. It&apos;s all about <a href=\"http://www.ntk.net/ballmer/mirrors.html\">developers, developers, developers, developers</a>...</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000168more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Since <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/\">Apple</a> <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/jan/10ilife.html\">announced</a> <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ilife/\">iLife 06</a> it seems that every man and his dog has set about to pirate it. I&apos;ve done some thinking about the ethical dimensions of this sudden burst of activity.</p>\n\n<p>First up, some disclosure. I am a software developer. I derive my income from selling <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/\">software</a>. Piracy hurts my business and I don&apos;t like it. But let&apos;s be clear: piracy is not &quot;theft&quot; or &quot;stealing&quot;; it&apos;s copyright infringement.</p>\n\n<p>I actually think that <a href=\"http://www.copyright.gov/\">copyright</a> is a pretty good thing. And it&apos;s not just an economic thing; not only does it help authors, programmers, musicians and other people to earn a living from what they do, it also enables things like the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html\">GPL</a> to exist. The GPL is a copyright license and without copyright open source software as we know it today probably couldn&apos;t exist.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the <a href=\"http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html\">&quot;fair use&quot;</a> provisions in the copyright law make it legal for you to do reasonable things with copyrighted works. Things like making backups, copying to different formats and the like. I think the copyright system is a fairly good one.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management\">Digital Rights Management (DRM)</a>, on the other hand, is where things can start to get ugly. Greedy content creators want to use DRM to deprive you of your &quot;fair use&quot; rights. At best they make it difficult or painful to exercise those rights; at worst they make it impossible. And things don&apos;t stop there; not only may you find yourself stripped of rights, but legislation like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMCA\">DMCA</a> makes it illegal to try and circumvent the DRM and recover those lost rights. The recent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_rootkit\">Sony &quot;rootkit&quot; debacle</a> is another example of DRM gone wrong; here the DRM not only took away &quot;fair use&quot; rights, it actually did damage to people&apos;s computers and put them at risk of remote compromise.</p>\n\n<p>So my stance as a software developer is that I am not a big fan of piracy. I don&apos;t really like DRM either, but I accept it as a &quot;necessary evil&quot;. Things like the iTunes Music Store, for instance, could not exist without DRM. The Apple DRM is acceptable to me because it does not deprive me of any of my &quot;fair use&quot; rights. Some of my own products use a form of DRM, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/activation/\">&quot;product activation&quot;</a>, but only in a way that preserves users&apos; fair use rights, shields them from inconvenience and which follows the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/activation/\">&quot;best practice&quot;</a> guidelines recommended by industry bodies.</p>\n\n<p>And even if I weren&apos;t a software developer I would be against piracy. I like to live an ethical life. I consider that people who make creative works have a right to stipulate conditions about how and when they should be used. You are then free to either accept or reject the conditions. In the case of software the condition is usually &quot;don&apos;t pirate this software&quot;, and it seems a reasonable enough stipulation; if that condition is objectionable to you then don&apos;t use the software. By respecting that condition you encourage further development and that&apos;s a win-win situation for you and the developer because it means the developer makes a living and you get better software. And if the condition seems overly draconian to you, you&apos;re free to start your own version of the software and release it as open source under the GPL, thereby ensuring that your creation will always remain free.</p>\n\n<p>But I think that ethical responsibility cuts both ways. I think software companies should behave ethically as well. In part that means refraining from screwing their customers (the Sony &quot;rootkit&quot; example). It also means making it easy for people to buy their software, and eliminating incentives to piracy. This means making copies available at reduced prices to students, or in the Third World and so forth. Set your prices fairly and don&apos;t drive people to piracy. You&apos;ll probably come out in front in the end thanks to the good will and loyalty that your fairness will generate.</p>\n\n<p>So that&apos;s the background, and it sheds some light on why I always take an interest when Apple makes a product announcement of this kind. The last time there was this much activity in the pirate community was probably with the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/apr/12tiger.html\">release</a> of <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/\">Mac OS X Tiger (10.4)</a>. Here follow some reflections on the ethical dimensions of pirating, or not pirating, iLife 06.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000173more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>iLife 06 won&apos;t be available in my country for three weeks; I&apos;ll buy it later</h4>\n\n<p>On first examination this position appears to be technically illegal but morally defensible. It <em>is</em> copyright infringement <em>but</em> if you&apos;re going to buy it later anyway you&apos;re really only just starting to use your &quot;fair use&quot; rights a little bit sooner than you should. No harm done, right?</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that the most popular mechanism for distributing large files like iLife is <a href=\"http://www.bittorrent.com/\">BitTorrent</a>, and an integral part of the BitTorrent protocol is that you don&apos;t just download files; you assist in distributing them to others. As you download pieces of a file from other peers in the swarm your computer sends out pieces to those peers too. You upload to others while you&apos;re downloading. As such, if you think that your decision to download iLife won&apos;t hurt Apple then perhaps you should think again; not only are you committing copyright infringement yourself but you&apos;re also helping others to infringe copyright too, and it&apos;s highly likely that you are distributing the file to people who have no intention of ever paying for iLife.</p>\n\n<h4>Apple is forcing me to pay for .Mac; this is my revenge</h4>\n\n<p>There are two problems with this position. One is that it is based on a false postulate (that Apple is &quot;forcing&quot; the user to pay for <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/dotmac/\">.Mac</a>). Apple is clearly <em>not</em> forcing anyone to pay for .Mac, they&apos;re merely encouraging people to do so. iLife will work without .Mac.</p>\n\n<p>The second problem takes us into the ground of moral philosophy; the claim that any kind of &quot;revenge&quot; is somehow morally justifiable. Almost all credible, modern religious and ethical frameworks make the opposite case. The &quot;eye for an eye&quot; philosophy is just so &quot;Old Testament&quot;. Our modern judicial system is built on the notion of &quot;just retribution&quot; rather than &quot;revenge&quot;, and the emphasis is much more on rehabilitation than on punishment (at least in theory).</p>\n\n<h4>I <em>need</em> iLife 06 right <em>now</em></h4>\n\n<p>Confusion between &quot;needing&quot; something and merely &quot;wanting&quot; it doesn&apos;t change the ethicality of piracy. It&apos;s quite clear that the people who say they &quot;need&quot; iLife 06 in reality only &quot;want&quot; it, and that misunderstanding does not in any way change the underlying ethical (or unethical) dimensions of their conduct.</p>\n\n<p>And anyway, what&apos;s wrong with iLife 05?</p>\n\n<h4>I bought a new Mac in December and now Apple&apos;s screwed me</h4>\n\n<p>I said above that I think software vendors should behave ethically too. By and large Apple does this: they give away lots of applications for free with every copy of Mac OS X, and they also make many of them available for free download to anybody at anytime (applications like Safari, QuickTime and of course iTunes; which is itself part of iLife); they also give away a copy of iLife with every new Mac sold.</p>\n\n<p>This seems more than reasonable on their part. In short, they do very little in the way of &quot;driving people to piracy&quot;, and they do a lot in the way of getting iLife into people&apos;s hands for free. For those who must pay, Apple sells the product of $79 (less if you&apos;re eligible for an educational discount); not bad for a set of applications which allows you to make near-professional quality CDs, DVDs, movies, songs, podcasts, webpages, greeting cards, calendars and much more.</p>\n\n<p>But there is something that people are complaining about: those who purchased Macs just prior to the iLife 06 announcement will find that they&apos;re stuck with iLife 05. Those who purchased <em>after</em> will be able to upgrade, effectively for free, via the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ilife/uptodate/\">Up-To-Date</a> program.</p>\n\n<p>So imagine if you bought a Mac on 9 January, received iLife 05, and missed out on being eligible for the Up-To-Date program by one measly day. You&apos;d probably be quite annoyed. If you went out and pirated iLife 06 you&apos;d be doing something illegal in the technical sense (copyright infringement) and immoral in the ethical sense (failing to respect the wishes of the author of a creative work), but there&apos;s a moral grey area here because Apple&apos;s decision to set the cut-off date for the Up-To-Date program at 10 January really starts to stretch the limits of &quot;reasonableness&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Like I said above, part of being an ethical software vendor means making it easy for customers to purchase your stuff. If you&apos;re too tough on your customers then you risk driving them towards piracy. Sure, in the end it&apos;s the pirate and not the vendor who&apos;s guilty of committing the infringement, but creating an environment in which piracy is much, much more likely to occur is not a good thing either. Most would agree that a much more reasonable (and therefore ethical) approach would have been to back-date the Up-To-Date program by at least 30 days and perhaps as many as 90. The end result would be less piracy, more good-will, and hopefully more long-term, loyal customers for Apple.</p>\n\n<h4>Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate&apos;s life for me</h4>\n\n<p>This is actually one of the more respectable stances in the spectrum of possibilities. In this stance the pirate does not attempt to rationalize, justify or otherwise defend their conduct. This position can be summed at more or less as follows: &quot;I want this software. I refuse to pay for it. I will pirate it.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Basically it boils down to a Darwinian struggle, a survival of the fittest, in which the software vendor tries to impede piracy and the pirate tries to get what he or she wants anyway. No moral reasoning or logic comes into play; it is simply a contest of wills.</p>\n\n<p>The pirate does not make any appeal to special status, nor does he/she make the tautological claim that the loser of the battle (in this case Apple) somehow &quot;deserved&quot; to lose because it was unable to defend itself. This kind of pirate tries neither to justify the illegality of the act nor sweep the moral dimensions under the rug. As such there is an &quot;ideological purity&quot; in their perspective. He may be a bastard but at least he is not a hypocrite.</p>\n\n<p>It is this later type of pirate which software developers will never defeat, because even if they invest thousands of hours coming up with anti-piracy technology such hard-line pirates will still attempt to crack it, and even if they fail they still won&apos;t give in and actually purchase the software.</p>\n\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n\n<p>So where do I stand in all this? As I stated above, I&apos;m a software developer and so that puts me fairly clearly in the anti-piracy camp. I&apos;ll be getting iLife 06 most likely within the next few weeks when my iMac arrives; I think it&apos;s unlikely that it will arrive in Spanish stores sooner than that date.</p>\n\n<p>One of the reasons I felt prompted to write this article is that so many of the people clamouring to download copies of iLife 06 for free seemed to show absolutely no awareness of the ethical dimensions of their decision to pirate the software. On the contrary, they seemed mired in a petulant mixture of self-pity, fury, egoism and lack of technical understanding about how peer-to-peer protocols and systems really work. Self-pity that they were being forced to wait so long to complete the illegal acquisition of the software; fury that their &quot;entitlement&quot; to the software was being thwarted by factors outside their control; egoism manifested in the belief that they were someone more deserving and should therefore get the software sooner than anyone else; ignorant in their attempts at manipulating the BitTorrent protocol so as to download the software as quickly as possible while minimizing their own contribution (uploading) back to the pirate community. The ideal of &quot;honor among thieves&quot; seems to be all too weak in the vast majority of the pirate community; it seems that there is all too little &quot;honor among copyright infringers&quot;, and while we&apos;re at it, all too little intelligence as well.</p>\n</div></div>",

Microsoft thinks he was right:</p>\n\n<blockquote>To &quot;solve&quot; the problem for consumers in the short run doesn&apos;t require eliminating spam entirely, said Ryan Hamlin, the general manager who oversees the company&apos;s anti-spam programs. Rather, he said, the idea is to contain it to the point that its impact on in-boxes is minor. In that way, Hamlin said, Gates&apos; prediction has come true for people using the right tactics and advanced filtering technology ... &quot;If you are a consumer that&apos;s taking advantage of the technologies that exist ... then the spam problem for you is solved,&quot; Hamlin said. &quot;Bill didn&apos;t say that there would be no spam. But he said the problem would be solved, and I think that is what we actually have accomplished.&quot;</blockquote>\n\n<p>My response: What a crock of tripe. At the client level 13% of all mail I receive is spam. That percentage would be much higher if it weren&apos;t for server-level blocking. More than 50% of all email sent on the Internet as a whole is spam. The MS claim that spam has been &quot;solved&quot; by &quot;using the right tactics and advanced filtering technology&quot; is bogus. The exact same thing was true two years ago (when I kept spam under control by &quot;using the right tactics and advanced filtering technology&quot;) so this is no more a &quot;prediction&quot; than me &quot;prophesying&quot; that two years from now people will be using programs called &quot;web browsers&quot; to access information hosted on remote servers. Time to go back to the old drawing board, Bill, and while you&apos;re there perhaps you should spend more time developing solutions and less time posing for the media as a &quot;visionary&quot; and &quot;prophet&quot;.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000182more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Earlier today I was lamenting in the &quot;mini-log&quot; that lives on the left-hand side of my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/\">weblog</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> is a huge project with lots of dependencies. I&apos;d really like to know why it insists on rebuilding almost all of the dependent projects every time I build... It means that if I change a single line of code I end up having to recompile the entire project and that takes many, many minutes. Do that lots of times in the day and it starts to add up.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, after identifying the problem I think I&apos;ve now come up with a solution.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000186more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>The problem</h4>\n\n<p>The problem was easy enough to identify. I like to embed build numbers in my binaries so that you get meaningful, informative output when you run the <tt>what</tt> command-line tool on them. The problem is that embedding these numbers on every build makes Xcode think that the source code has changed, so it will recompile the project even if nothing else has changed. Then every other project that depends on that project will need to be rebuilt (or at the very least re-linked) as well. This becomes a problem when you have a complex hierarchy of projects like I do in Synergy Advance. The tree looks something like this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Synergy Advance application\n    <ul>\n      <li>Synergy Advance framework\n        <ul>\n          <li>WOBase framework\n            <ul>\n              <li>WOTest framework</li>\n              <li>WODebug framework\n                  <ul>\n                    <li>WOTest framework</li>\n                  </ul>\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n          <li>WODebug framework\n            <ul>\n              <li>WOTest framework</li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n          <li>WOTest framework</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>WOBase framework\n        <ul>\n          <li>WOTest framework</li>\n          <li>WODebug framework\n            <ul>\n              <li>WOTest framework</li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>WOBezel framework\n        <ul>\n          <li>WOTest framework</li>\n          <li>WODebug framework\n            <ul>\n              <li>WOTest framework</li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>WOHotKey framework\n        <ul>\n          <li>WOTest framework </li>\n          <li>WODebug framework\n            <ul>\n              <li>WOTest framework</li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>Various plug-ins\n        <ul>\n          <li>Synergy Advance Framework\n            <ul>\n              <li>WOBase framework\n                <ul>\n                  <li>WOTest framework</li>\n                  <li>WODebug framework\n                      <ul>\n                        <li>WOTest framework</li>\n                      </ul>\n                  </li>\n                </ul>\n              </li>\n              <li>WODebug framework\n                <ul>\n                  <li>WOTest framework</li>\n                </ul>\n              </li>\n              <li>WOTest framework</li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>Various Preference Panes\n        <ul>\n          <li>Synergy Advance Framework\n              <ul>\n                <li>WOBase framework\n                    <ul>\n                      <li>WOTest framework</li>\n                      <li>WODebug framework\n                          <ul>\n                            <li>WOTest framework</li>\n                          </ul>\n                      </li>\n                    </ul>\n                </li>\n                <li>WODebug framework\n                  <ul>\n                    <li>WOTest framework</li>\n                  </ul>\n                </li>\n                <li>WOTest framework</li>\n              </ul>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>WOTest framework</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And this chart hides some of the complexity because the plug-ins and preference panes are all grouped together under the two &quot;various&quot; headings, and the WODebug framework itself includes an application (Wincent Crash Reporter) which itself depends on the framework; so everywhere you see &quot;WODebug framework&quot; in the list above the actual dependency graph looks like this (references to WOTest omitted for clarity):</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>WODebug framework\n    <ul>\n      <li>Wincent Crash Reporter\n        <ul>\n          <li>WODebug framework without Wincent Crash Reporter</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All that modularity is a trade-off of one type of complexity for another. The dependency graph starts to look horrible and compile times go up, but it allows me to work on smaller pieces of code at a time and benefit from code re-use and so in theory speeds up development. In practice, however, things are not so pretty. Every time I built the project the and the build numbers were getting bumped on the lower-level dependencies (WODebug, for example) everything that depended on it was getting needlessly re-built and/or re-linked.</p>\n\n<h4>The solution</h4>\n\n<p>The solution is to selectively bump the build numbers only when something actually changes in the source tree. I came up with the following script that checks for file hierarchy changes and calculates a hash that represents the state of the hierarchy. It produces a different hash whenever the modification date of any file in the source tree is changed, or any file is added, removed or renamed. I&apos;ve omitted the &quot;-a&quot; switch to &quot;ls&quot; so it won&apos;t consider invisible files.</p>\n\n<pre>#!/bin/sh\n<br>\n/bin/mkdir -p &quot;${DERIVED_FILE_DIR}&quot;\n<br>\nTREEINFO=`/bin/ls -lTR &quot;${SOURCE_ROOT}&quot;`\nNEWHASH=`echo &quot;${TREEINFO}&quot; | /usr/bin/openssl sha1`\nHASHFILE=&quot;${DERIVED_FILE_DIR}/${FULL_PRODUCT_NAME}.sourcehash&quot;\nINFOFILE=&quot;${DERIVED_FILE_DIR}/${FULL_PRODUCT_NAME}.treeinfo&quot;\n<br>\necho &quot;Source tree hash: ${NEWHASH}&quot;\n<br>\nif [ -f &quot;${HASHFILE}&quot; ]; then\n  OLDHASH=`/bin/cat &quot;${HASHFILE}&quot;`\n  echo &quot;Old source tree hash: ${OLDHASH}&quot;\n  if [ $OLDHASH = $NEWHASH ]; then\n    echo &quot;Source tree unchanged: not updating build number&quot;\n    exit 0\n  else\n    if [ -f &quot;${INFOFILE}&quot; ]; then\n      echo &quot;Tree differences:&quot;\n      echo &quot;${TREEINFO}&quot; | /usr/bin/diff &quot;${INFOFILE}&quot; -    \n    fi\n  fi  \nfi\n<br>\necho &quot;Updating build version number&quot;\n. &quot;${SOURCE_ROOT}/../../WOBase/svn-files/UpdateBuildVersionNumbers.sh&quot; \\\n  &quot;WODebug_Version.h&quot;\n<br>\n# updating the build number changes the hash, so must update it:\nTREEINFO=`/bin/ls -lTR &quot;${SOURCE_ROOT}&quot;`\nNEWHASH=`echo &quot;${TREEINFO}&quot; | /usr/bin/openssl sha1`\n<br>\necho &quot;Writing hash to disk&quot;\necho &quot;${NEWHASH}&quot; &gt; &quot;${HASHFILE}&quot;\necho &quot;Writing tree info to disk&quot;\necho &quot;${TREEINFO}&quot; &gt; &quot;${INFOFILE}&quot;</pre>\n\n<p>The <tt>UpdateBuildVersionNumbers.sh</tt> script referenced above is hideously complex and so rather than show it/explain here I&apos;ll leave imagining how it might work in the &quot;exercise for the reader&quot; category. It suffices to say that it parses the &quot;WODebug_Version.h&quot; file and bumps the build number and updates the other info as appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>I can&apos;t foresee any problems with rolling the functionality of this script into the <tt>UpdateBuildVersionNumbers.sh</tt> script itself so I&apos;ll probably do that shortly so that I can benefit from this work in all of my projects which use that script.</p>\n\n<h4>Does it work?</h4>\n\n<p>In the small amount of testing I&apos;ve done since putting together the solution it does indeed appear to work as you would expect. If you rebuild a project the dependent projects only get rebuilt if they&apos;ve actually changed. If you hit &quot;Clean All&quot; then you blow away the hash and &quot;tree info&quot; files and so the dependent projects get rebuilt too (which is what you&apos;d expect when you hit &quot;Clean All&quot;!).</p>\n\n<p>I included the <tt>diff</tt> output that shows the differences between source trees because I wanted to see what changes were being made which would provoke a full rebuild. It turns out that occasionally Xcode makes changes to the <tt>xcodeproj</tt> bundle and the files inside it and these are enough to provoke a build number update. I don&apos;t know what it is that Xcode&apos;s doing to these files nor why, but it doesn&apos;t seem to happen often enough to warrant specifically excluding those files from the hash calculation (on the next build Xcode tends to leave the files untouched, and so the hash remains unchanged and unnecessary build number bumping and rebuilding is avoided).</p>\n\n<p>A limitation of the script is that it will be easily fooled by nested source hierarchies. For example, my &quot;Synergy Advance Framework&quot; source hierarchy is actually a subdirectory of the main &quot;Synergy Advance&quot; folder. This means that if the framework build number is bumped the application build number <em>will</em> get bumped even if there are no changes to the application&apos;s source itself. This may be exactly the behavior that you&apos;re looking for but in my case I prefer that the build number for &quot;X&quot; be independent of the build number for &quot;Y&quot; even if &quot;X&quot; depends on &quot;Y&quot;; it&apos;s the combination of the two that&apos;s meaningful anyway. So I think that I&apos;ll end up moving the framework source to a separate location so that this kind of thing doesn&apos;t happen.</p>\n\n<p>This has shaved huge amounts of time off of my builds. It&apos;s still a large project and it still takes a non-trivial amount of time to build (Xcode still checks the project dependencies, still runs any other shell script phases set to run in the dependent projects, and still links the dependent projects and makes Universal Binaries of them) but even so we are still talking of a time saving that is probably in the &quot;several orders of magnitude&quot; ballpark. I just wish I&apos;d done this sooner. <em>Why didn&apos;t I?</em></p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Managing build settings in Xcode has always been a bit fiddley. You can have per-project build settings (called &quot;Configurations&quot;), and per-target settings (simply called &quot;Build settings&quot;) which inherit from the per-project settings and can be used to override them. Things can get fairly complicated very quickly when you have multiple configurations, multiple targets and multiple projects. That&apos;s not even mentioning the possibility of passing settings on the command-line or in the environment, nor of <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/XcodeUserGuide/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/05_04_bs_build_settings/chapter_31_section_8.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002691-CHDBDDBI\">setting compiler flags on a per-file basis</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One of the problems is that there are <em>so many</em> settings and the UI doesn&apos;t make it easy to feel sure that you&apos;ve got your settings consistently applied across projects. Another is that if you&apos;ve ever been struck down by an Xcode project file corruption bug you won&apos;t have a nice time at all trying to recreate your project from scratch and get all the settings right.</p>\n\n<p>But one of my key gripes with configurations is that mostly they consist of standard settings with a few deviations from the default. Your &quot;Debug&quot; configuration is most likely exactly like your &quot;Release&quot; configuration, for example, with a few small changes. But sometimes you want to make a change that should apply to both: do you edit them both? Or do you apply the setting on a per-target basis? If you have lots of targets then editing the setting in two configurations will be easier than editing it in multiple targes. If you have lots of configurations (let&apos;s say you  have &quot;Profiling&quot;, &quot;Code coverage&quot; and &quot;Beta testing&quot; in addition to &quot;Debug&quot; and &quot;Release&quot;) but only one target then perhaps editing it there will be easier. Often you find yourself making the same changes over and over again in every single new project that you start (for example, I almost always end up setting <tt>GCC_C_LANGUAGE_STANDARD</tt> to <tt>GNU99</tt>).</p>\n\n<p>Just today I was thinking how great it would be if configuration settings were capable of inheriting from each other. That is, you could define your &quot;Release&quot; configuration and you could define your &quot;Debug&quot; configuration as being based on &quot;Release&quot; with some overrides. &quot;Debug&quot; would inherit from &quot;Release&quot;; make a change to &quot;Release&quot; and it would be automatically inherited by &quot;Debug&quot; unless you explicitly override it.</p>\n\n<p>I was about to <a href=\"https://bugreport.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/RadarWeb.woa\">file a feature request</a> for this when I stumbled across something that I had overlooked or filed away in the mental &quot;look-at-it-later&quot; basket. It turns out that <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/XcodeUserGuide/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/05_05_build_configs/chapter_32_section_6.html\">you already can</a> do pretty much exactly what I am talking about. By using what Apple calls &quot;Configuration files&quot; (can&apos;t they have come up with a less generic name?) which end in an <tt>xcconfig</tt> extension you can define a set of build settings and then inherit from them in any project-level configuration, and in any per-target build settings. Even better, because these are plain text files you can store common settings in them and then use the same configuration file across multiple projects. Change that one file and al the projects automatically inherit the change. You can even include other configuration files via an <tt>include</tt> directive, effectively allowing you to build up an Object-Oriented-like inheritance hierarchy, and it&apos;s all plain text so it plays nicely with version control and makes it very easy to see build settings at a glance.</p>\n\n<p>Configuration files neatly take care of one of the main problems with the build settings interface. Instead of seeing a confusing mess of bold settings (overrides) and unbolded settings (inherited or default values) you can now set your view to &quot;Customized settings&quot; and you&apos;ll get a nice uncluttered view with only a few settings in it. Without configuration files it can be time consuming to tell exactly where build settings are coming from: are they overridden at the project or target level? With configuration files it&apos;s that much easier to see at a glance what&apos;s really going on.</p>\n\n<p>And with Apple&apos;s typical attention to detail and UI polish, setting up an <tt>xcconfig</tt> file is a breeze. Just select build settings in the Xcode build settings view, copy, and paste into a text file: the key/value pairs are translated for you. It&apos;s funny how sometimes a slick Aqua GUI isn&apos;t the best was for working with information; in this case a plain old text file turns out to be better (by way of a counterexample consider the complexity of makefiles and how Xcode&apos;s elegant GUI neatly disposes of the underlying complexity of dependency graphs.) The build configurations implementation is one example of the wedding of both ways: the lickable Aqua on top and the plain and simple text files underneath. Neither on its own is perfect but add them together and you have something that works great.</p>\n\n<p>This is great. I wish I&apos;d taken notice of this sooner.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000192more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Some time ago I wrote about <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2005/06/mock_objects_in.php\">adding mock objects to WOTest</a>. Over the last couple of days I set about trying to improve them and make them more elegant and flexible. In the process I&apos;ve learnt a lot of about message dispatch system in Apple&apos;s Objective-C runtime. Too much. Read on if you&apos;d like to see the story of a journey from a position of relative ignorance to not-quite-as-much ignorance.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000200more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>Mock objects in WOTest are basically used like this:</p>\n\n<pre>WOMock *mock = [WOMock mockForClass:[NSString class]];\n[[mock expect] lowercaseString];\n[mock lowercaseString];\n[mock verify];</pre>\n\n<p>That&apos;s a simple example (that you&apos;d probably never ever see in real testing) that sets up the mock, tells it to expect a message, sends the messages, and then asks the mock for confirmation that it received the message. Why would you want to set up a mock to stand in for <tt>NSString</tt> anyway? Why not just use <tt>NSString</tt> itself directly? There are two reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You can&apos;t ask <tt>NSString</tt> for confirmation that it received a message but you can ask a mock object. This may seem ridiculous in this contrived example &#x2014; after all, you know it received the message because you yourself sent it right then and there! &#x2014; but there are testing situations in which the message should be sent by some other &quot;third-party&quot; object not under your direct control and you&apos;ll want to confirm that it fulfilled the expectation.</li>\n<li>It doesn&apos;t matter if the documented (or undocumented) behaviour of<tt>NSString</tt> changes in the future because your mock will always behave the same. The mock provides you with a consistent foundation that you can use to test something else (after all, if you want to test the behaviour of <tt>NSString</tt> you should probably be testing it directly!).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A much more common example involves using mock objects to stand in for classes of your own design that are under construction but not finished yet, or which can&apos;t conveniently be used in a testing scenario. For example:</p>\n\n<pre>NSArray *plugins = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@&quot;foo&quot;, @&quot;bar&quot;, nil];\nWOMock *mock = [WOMock mockForClass:[WOPlugin class]];\n[[[mock accept] returning:plugins] allPlugins];\nWO_TEST_EQUAL([mock allPlugins], plugins);</pre>\n\n<p>Another contrived example, but it will suffice. The mock is told to stand in for a &quot;plugin&quot; class and return a list of plugins (&quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;). For the purposes of illustration the example uses a macro, <tt>WO_TEST_EQUAL</tt>, to make sure the mock returned the expected list. It&apos;s fairly easy to imagine the benefit of using mock objects to perform controlled testing of other parts of the code without directly involving the <tt>WOPlugin</tt> class itself (perhaps you haven&apos;t finished writing it yet, or you want to test it separately, or you simply wish to test an artificial situation which would be difficult to contrive without mocks).</p>\n\n<p>The trouble here is that you can only tell the mock to accept or expect methods which the class really does implement. That is, if you want to test a new method <tt>pluginHash</tt> but you haven&apos;t started writing it yet then you cannot use a mock object to stand in until you&apos;ve at the very least written an empty implementation (a &quot;stub&quot; in mock object parlance) in the real <tt>WOPlugin</tt> class:</p>\n\n<pre>- (unsigned)pluginHash\n{\n    // TODO: actually write a real hash implementation!\n    return (unsigned)self;\n}</pre>\n\n<p>The reason why you need this method stub in place is that the Objective-C runtime depends on it to be able to figure out a method signature (more on this below). This severely limits the usefulness of mock objects as stand-ins for incomplete or inaccessible implementations. You may find yourself asking why you would use a mock object at all in cases like this when you could just throw some temporary code into the real implementation (a stub) that will perform any &quot;mock behaviour&quot; that you&apos;re looking for. Mocks still have some advantages, but they&apos;d be even better if they didn&apos;t have this limitation.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing that the Objective-C runtime is incredibly dynamic and flexible I set about overcoming the restriction. The idea was to have the mock record any invocation at all, not just ones for which the mocked class already had a method signatures. It turns out that I haven&apos;t yet been able to achieve this goal and I think it may not be possible ever, due to the design of the runtime.</p>\n\n<h4>About method signatures and the flow of execution</h4>\n\n<p>So your mock is a subclass of <tt>NSProxy</tt> which is designed to stand in for other classes. Messages sent to the proxy wind up at this method and are forwarded from there to the real thing:</p>\n\n<pre>- (void)forwardInvocation:(NSInvocation *)anInvocation</pre>\n\n<p>The idea is that instead of forwarding to the &quot;real thing&quot;, your mock steps in and handles it anyway.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that in order to create such an <tt>NSInvocation</tt>, the runtime needs a thing called an <tt>NSMethodSignature</tt>, which it gets from this method:</p>\n\n<pre>- (NSMethodSignature *)methodSignatureForSelector:(SEL)aSelector</pre>\n\n<p>So that makes two methods you have to override. The trouble, <a href=\"http://www.stuffonfire.com/2005/12/signaturewithobjctypes_is_stil.html\">as stated here</a>, is that there is no easy way to make a method signature. In fact, there are no public APIs for it at all. There is a private method, but I always try to avoid using private or undocumented APIs whenever I can; here&apos;s the declaration of the private method in question (obtained using <a href=\"http://www.codethecode.com/Projects/class-dump/\">class-dump</a>):</p>\n\n<pre>+ (id)signatureWithObjCTypes:(const char *)fp8;</pre>\n\n<p>I did look at writing my own method for making method signatures and adding it to a category of <tt>NSMethodSignature</tt> but the implementation required me to directly mess with instance variables and I didn&apos;t feel good about doing that. It felt even nastier than using a private API so I resigned myself to using that private API.</p>\n\n<p>You might think your troubles are over at that point because you have a method for making method signatures. Unfortunately it is not so. How do you get the list of types?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is that only the runtime knows, and how does it know? It knows because it knew them at compile time. It knew them at compile time, which meant that it knew them at link time, which means that it knows it at runtime. You can find this sort of stuff out by using the low-level functions like <tt>class_getInstanceMethod</tt> to find information about methods. But you&apos;ll only ever be able to find information about methods that the compiler knew about at compile time. This means that you can get a method signature for the <tt>lowercaseString</tt> method of <tt>NSString</tt>, and you can get a method signature for the <tt>allPlugins</tt> method of <tt>WOPlugin</tt> (but only if you included at least a skeletal implementation of it at compile time). If you want to figure out the method signature for a new, unwritten method like our example, <tt>pluginHash</tt>, you&apos;re out of luck.</p>\n\n<p>But surely that can&apos;t be the end of the story, you say. The runtime is dynamic! If you send a message dynamically at runtime then you should be able to capture information about it! Consider the following example:</p>\n\n<pre>[[mock expect] fancy:@&quot;foo&quot; smancy:@&quot;bar&quot;]</pre>\n\n<p>This is valid, legal, Objective-C. The compiler might warn you about code like this (saying that selector <tt>fancy:smancy:</tt> may not be recognized by the class) but it is valid code and it will execute. The compiler will dutifully replace this with a call to <tt>objc_msgSend()</tt>. In normal use you will see an exception if you send an unrecognized selector, but in this case you want the mock object to record the selector and remember it for later.</p>\n\n<p>So what happens at runtime? Ultimately the following selector gets called (this is another private <tt>NSProxy</tt> API discovered with class-dump) and an exception is thrown:</p>\n\n<pre>- (void)doesNotRecognizeSelector:(SEL)fp8</pre>\n\n<p>I wanted to see what the flow of execution was. Here&apos;s the stack trace at the time the exception is raised:</p>\n\n<pre>_NSRaiseError\n[NSException raise:format:]\n[NSObject(NSForwardInvocation) forward::]\n_objc_msgForward</pre>\n\n<p><tt>objc_msgSend</tt> does not appear in the stack trace but it is responsible for jumping to <tt>_objc_msgForward</tt>. More class-dump research reveals the following method in an <tt>NSObject</tt> category called <tt>NSForwardInvocation</tt>; this corresponds to the third line of the stack trace shown above:</p>\n\n<pre>- (long long)forward:(SEL)fp8:(void *)fp12;</pre>\n\n<h4>How unrecognized selectors are handled in the Apple runtime</h4>\n\n<p>So I started getting serious about searching Google for information on the message dispatch process used by the Apple runtime, and particularly how it handles unrecognized selectors. There is documentation for the runtime, but it is mostly high-level discussion of functions like <tt>objc_msgSend</tt> and doesn&apos;t delve into the low-level details; the runtime is mostly written in hand-coded assembly for speed.</p>\n\n<p>I found <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/chrootstrap/custom_objective_c_root_classes.html\">this article</a> about making your own root classes and it indicates that &quot;your root class will need to recognize <tt>forward</tt> messages due to a little assertion Apple has&quot;. I had forgotten about this but now I remember that in the past when I&apos;d made a custom root class I had to stumble across that same article before I could get things to work.</p>\n\n<p>So what we see here is a private, undocumented method, <tt>_objc_msgForward</tt> invoking a private, undocumented method, <tt>forward::</tt>. In truth it&apos;s not totally private; it&apos;s just that it&apos;s not advertised. You can look at the assembly language implementation of this and other functions by downloading the Darwin source.</p>\n\n<p>The <tt>forward::</tt> method is called when no implementation can be found for a selector. If the <tt>forward::</tt> method is not implemented then an exception is raised. In the default implementation (as found in <tt>NSProxy</tt>) <tt>forward::</tt> invokes <tt>methodSignatureForSelector:</tt> and then uses the returned signature to construct an invocation and passes it to <tt>forwardInvocation:</tt>. If there is no method signature then the invocation cannot be created and <tt>doesNotRecognizeSelector</tt> is called.</p>\n\n<p>The <tt>Object</tt> root class defines a similar method:</p>\n\n<pre>- forward: (SEL)sel : (marg_list)args;</pre>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/gnustep/core/base/Source/NSObject.m\">NSObject class</a> in GNUstep defines it this way:</p>\n\n<pre>- (retval_t) forward:(SEL)aSel :(arglist_t)argFrame;</pre>\n\n<p>A little further hunting (this time through <a href=\"http://darwinsource.opendarwin.org/10.4.3/objc4-267/runtime/Messengers.subproj/\">the Darwin source code</a>) reveals that the signature is officially: </p>\n\n<pre>- forward:(SEL)sel :(marg_list)args;</pre>\n\n<p>So the question then becomes, what kind of useful information can we extract from this marg_list parameter, and can we use it to construct a method signature?</p>\n\n<h4>Trying to find out more about the <tt>marg_list</tt> type</h4>\n\n<p>According to the documentation a <tt>marg_list</tt> is a &quot;reference to an argument list&quot;. It&apos;s defined like this:</p>\n\n<pre>typedef void * marg_list;</pre>\n\n<p>I started looking at the Darwin source to see if I could figure out what was being pointed at by this marg_list parameter. The <tt>_objc_msgForward</tt> interface itself adopts one of two forms depending on the contents of the r11 register (on ppc; on i386 the secret flag is in edx):</p>\n\n<pre>id _objc_msgForward(id\tself, SEL\tsel, ...);\nstruct_type _objc_msgForward(id\tself, SEL\tsel, ...);</pre>\n\n<p>The Darwin source also notes:</p>\n\n<pre> * But the marg_list is prepended with the 13 double precision\n * floating point registers that could be used as parameters into\n * the method (fortunately, the same registers are used for either\n * single or double precision floats).  These registers are layed\n * down by _objc_msgForward, and picked up by _objc_msgSendv.  So\n * the &quot;marg_list&quot; is actually:\n *\n * typedef struct objc_sendv_margs {\n *\tdouble\t\tfloatingPointArgs[13];\n *\tint\t\tlinkageArea[6];\n *\tint\t\tregisterArgs[8];\n *\tint\t\tstackArgs[variable];\n * };</pre>\n\n<p>Notes on <tt>objc_msgSendv</tt> for i386:</p>\n\n<pre>/********************************************************************\n * id objc_msgSendv(id self, SEL _cmd, unsigned size, marg_list frame);\n *\n * On entry:\n *\t\t(sp+4)  is the message receiver,\n *\t\t(sp+8)\tis the selector,\n *\t\t(sp+12) is the size of the marg_list, in bytes,\n *\t\t(sp+16) is the address of the marg_list\n *\n ********************************************************************/</pre>\n\n<p>Notes for ppc:</p>\n\n<pre>/********************************************************************\n * id\t\tobjc_msgSendv(id\tself,\n *\t\t\tSEL\t\top,\n *\t\t\tunsigned\targ_size,\n *\t\t\tmarg_list\targ_frame);\n *\n * But the marg_list is prepended with the 13 double precision\n * floating point registers that could be used as parameters into\n * the method (fortunately, the same registers are used for either\n * single or double precision floats).

This is consistent with the other architectures.\n ********************************************************************/</pre>\n\n<h4>Putting together the pieces... or at least trying to</h4>\n\n<p>So we now have some idea about the flow of execution. These three methods will be called in order and must all be overriden:</p>\n\n<pre>- forward:(SEL)sel :(marg_list)args;\n- (NSMethodSignature *)methodSignatureForSelector:(SEL)aSelector\n- (void)forwardInvocation:(NSInvocation *)anInvocation</pre>\n\n<p>The question is, do we have enough information available to construct a method signature? The first two methods receive the selector and we can easily get a human-readable string representation from that. The first method also passes a pointer to a <tt>marg_list</tt> (and at least that type is discussed in the Apple documentation, unlike the GNUstep <tt>arglist_t</tt> type). By the time we get to the third method we already need to know the method signature otherwise the passed invocation never could have been constructed. We also know that at least in the <tt>objc_msgSendv</tt> method, the pointer to and the length of the <tt>marg_list</tt> is known, but we don&apos;t have access to the runtime at such a low-level because the three methods mentioned above are operating at a much higher level. The Darwin source reveals some detail about how arguments are passed via registers and on the stack, but by the time we get our hands on the <tt>marg_list</tt> at a higher level it looks like that information is no longer available.</p>\n\n<p>Can we construct anything from just a selector? The answer seems to be no, unless the runtime already knows something about it (in which case it had to be known at compile time too). Can we extract anything from the <tt>marg_list</tt> pointer? Once again the answer seems to be no. It is just a pointer to a slab of memory and we have no way of knowing how big that slab is. We can deduce the number of arguments by looking at the number of colons in the selector string, but that doesn&apos;t help us because the arguments may be of different sizes (pointers, ints, chars, arrays and so forth).</p>\n\n<p>Let&apos;s wind the clock back a little bit. Does the runtime know more about the arguments at the time <tt>objc_msgSend</tt> is called? This is a function that takes a variable number of arguments. As far as I can tell, the only way <tt>objc_msgSend</tt> can learn about the arguments is by querying the runtime. Presuming that <tt>objc_msgSend</tt> uses the standard <tt>va_start</tt>, <tt>va_arg</tt> and <tt>va_end</tt> macros then the only way it can know the type of each argument is to query the runtime beforehand.</p>\n\n<p>I made a small foundation tool that created an instance of a <tt>NSProxy</tt> subclass and sent a couple of messages. I wanted to see what kind of assembly the compiler generated for a line like this.</p>\n\n<pre>[TestProxy message:@&quot;foobar&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>It turns out that the compiler generates type strings like &quot;@8@0:4\\0&quot; with labels such as <tt>L_OBJC_METH_VAR_TYPE_0</tt> for methods that <em>are</em> implemented. For methods that are messaged but <em>not</em> implemented no such type information is stored, although the compiler still does generate a call to <tt>objc_msgSend</tt>. Here is a partial listing which shows the salient bits of the generated code:</p>\n\n<pre>L_OBJC_METH_VAR_NAME_0:\n\t.ascii &quot;message:\\0&quot;\nL_OBJC_CLASS_NAME_0:\n\t.ascii &quot;TestProxy\\0&quot;\nL_OBJC_CLASS_REFERENCES_0:\n\t.long\tL_OBJC_CLASS_NAME_0\nL_OBJC_SELECTOR_REFERENCES_0:\n\t.long\tL_OBJC_METH_VAR_NAME_0\nLC0:\n\t.ascii &quot;foobar\\0&quot;\nLC1:\n\t.long\t___CFConstantStringClassReference\n\t.long\t1992\n\t.long\tLC0\n_main:\n\tmflr r0\n\tlis r3,ha16(L_OBJC_CLASS_REFERENCES_0)     ; receiver\n\tlis r4,ha16(L_OBJC_SELECTOR_REFERENCES_0)  ; selector\n\tlis r5,ha16(LC1)\n\tstw r0,8(r1)\n\tstwu r1,-64(r1)\n\tla r5,lo16(LC1)(r5)\n\tlwz r3,lo16(L_OBJC_CLASS_REFERENCES_0)(r3)\n\tlwz r4,lo16(L_OBJC_SELECTOR_REFERENCES_0)(r4)\n\tbl L_objc_msgSend$stub</pre>\n\n<p>As documented in the Darwin source, r3 is the message receiver (the <tt>TestProxy</tt> class) and r4 is the selector. The IA-32 function calling conventions (how parameters are passed and values returned) are <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/LowLevelABI/Articles/IA32.html\">discussed here</a>. Those for 32-bit PowerPC can be <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/LowLevelABI/Articles/32bitPowerPC.html\">found here</a> (see <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/LowLevelABI/Articles/64bitPowerPC.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002471-SW14\">this document for 64-bit PowerPC</a>). By the time we get to our <tt>forward::</tt> implementation, it seems that this knowledge won&apos;t be helpful to us anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Can we get clever and construct a signature with partial information in <tt>forward::</tt> or elsewhere and later fill it in or replace it when we have more info? It seems that the answer is no. We can indeed create a partial signature and things will &quot;work&quot; in a way (that is, the messages will be sent) but we lose information in the process that makes the resulting invocation much less useful (for example, it means that we can no longer compare method signatures meaningfully for equality, and extracting arguments won&apos;t work as expected). And it seems that there is no other point in the program flow where we&apos;ll have more information.</p>\n\n<p>So at this point I bow my head and admit defeat. I couldn&apos;t solve the problem but at least I struggled from a position of total ignorance to less-complete ignorance.

    "html": "<p>Why is it that a spindle of 25 <a href=\"http://verbatim.com/\">Verbatim</a> DVD-Rs costs 38,95&#x20AC; at my favorite local store (<a href=\"http://www.fnac.es/\">FNAC</a>)? Yet I can buy the same(*) spindle at the corner shop for 14,95&#x20AC;? (* Ok, it&apos;s not exactly the same: the DVD-Rs sold at FNAC are certified for 16x burning and the corner shop ones only for 8x; but apart from that they both seem to be the genuine article).</p>\n\n<p>I care about the price because I do a daily burn of my entire home directory (compressed) to DVD-R. I do this because my livelihood depends on my data. Erasing and re-writing DVD+RWs is not an attractive option; too much hassle doing the erasing and maintaining a rotation schedule. And if my business isn&apos;t strong enough to afford a non-reusable DVD-R blank each day then perhaps I&apos;m in the wrong business...</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless it has long bothered me that the prices of the media at FNAC have barely dropped over the last couple of years. I remember when a 25-spindle of <a href=\"http://tdk.com/\">TDK</a> media cost 43,95&#x20AC;, but since then it&apos;s only dropped 5&#x20AC;. When my friends in Australia were getting brand-name DVD-R blanks for less that A$1 each I&apos;ve been paying 1,56&#x20AC; (almost triple the cost!). Having switched to the corner shop I am now paying 0,60&#x20AC;, a much more reasonable price. The slower burn rating doesn&apos;t bother me either because I always burn at the slowest setting anyway (was getting far too many coasters; I suspect my burner isn&apos;t quite up to scratch).</p>\n\n<p>If I were to forgo the Verbatim brand I could get a 50-spindle for a mere 19,95&#x20AC; (0,40&#x20AC; per disc) but given the importance of the data I&apos;m not ready to do that just yet. Meanwhile, a double-layer Verbatim DVD+R costs an incredible 9,45&#x20AC; (for a single unit!) at FNAC. Spindles of any size are not even on the shelves yet. Won&apos;t be switching to double-layer anytime soon as much as I would like to; for the time-being my home directory is limited to about 19GB, which when compressed and temporary files are excluded fits onto a single, single-layer DVD-R.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000199more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Last night between the hours of 4 and 5 AM I was battling against two annoying Xcode bugs (in fact, the late hour immediately upgraded them to &quot;incredibly annoying&quot;).</p>\n\n<h3>Annoying bug #1</h3>\n\n<p>I spent about an hour wondering why any macros that I inserted into my <tt>Info.plist</tt> file where getting eaten when I turned on info property list preprocessing. For example, I have a macro defined like this:</p>\n\n<pre>#define WO_INFO_PLIST_VERSION 1.2</pre>\n\n<p>When I tried to insert that into my property list it didn&apos;t work. On preprocessing it was replaced with nothing (ie. it disappeared); I <em>knew</em> the preprocessor was seeing the macro because it was removing it, but I had no idea why it wasn&apos;t <em>substituting</em> the appropriate content. There is little official documentation on how to do this. The one or two references that you&apos;ll find on the Apple site use examples like this:</p>\n\n<pre>&lt;string&gt;$(PRODUCT_NAME)&lt;/string&gt;</pre>\n\n<p>Nothing I tried would work. In desperation I tried various options.</p>\n\n<pre>${WO_INFO_PLIST_VERSION}\n$(WO_INFO_PLIST_VERSION)\nWO_INFO_PLIST_VERSION</pre>\n\n<p>I was puzzled because I&apos;d used the preprocessing feature in the past with success (although &quot;puzzled&quot; was upgraded to &quot;frustrated&quot; via the automatic &quot;Wee Small Hours Upgrade&quot;). I then tried examples from the documentation (like <tt>$(PRODUCT_NAME)</tt>) and they didn&apos;t work either! What the hell was going on?</p>\n\n<p>No matter what I did the output was the same. I began to doubt that Xcode was actually updating the file. So in between each build I was hand-deleting the property list file to make sure that a new one would be generated. The problem persisted.</p>\n\n<p>Now, perhaps I could have solved this more quickly if I hadn&apos;t been so tired, but it was late and I wasted a good half hour before I hit &quot;Clean&quot; and everything worked. In short, the bug is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>When info property list preprocessing is turned on, Xcode does not &quot;see&quot; modifications to the project&apos;s <tt>Info.plist</tt> file even when you make those modifications and save the file from within Xcode itself; it reuses the same, stale copy from the build intermediates directory over and over again. The workaround is to do a clean.</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am still too annoyed about this &#x2014; and too busy trying to get the next preview release of Synergy Advance ready to ship &#x2014; to file a bug report.</p>\n\n<h4>Update: March 2007</h4>\n\n<p>For some more insights into the different build settings for processing and preprocessing <tt>Info.plist</tt> files see <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Setting_up_a_nightly_build_system\">this Knowledge base article</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Annoying bug #2</h3>\n\n<p>This next one isn&apos;t so bad, but it is a little pesky. For a long time now I&apos;ve wondered why the shell script I use to update my strings files runs <em>every, single, build</em> even when no updates are necessary. The shell script adds between 30 to 60 seconds to each build and the effect is multiplied when the project in question is later included as a dependency of another, higher-level project.</p>\n\n<p>The Apple docs say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Xcode uses the input and output files to determine whether to run the script and to determine the order in which the script is executed. Specifying input and output files ensures that Xcode runs the script only when the modification date of any of the input files is later than the modification date of any of the output files (reducing the time it takes to build your product), and that the files the script produces are included in the dependency analysis the build system performs before building your product. If you provide no outputs, Xcode runs the script every time you build the target.</blockquote>\n\n<p>In my case the input and output file settings were being totally ignored and I still don&apos;t know why. Tired of putting up with this, I modified my shell script so that <em>it</em> did the work that Xcode should have been doing (comparing modification dates before deciding whether to actually do anything). So chalk up another workaround for Wincent. It&apos;s still disappointing though, because it reduces the ease with which the same script can be reused in other projects.</p>\n\n<p>These little bugs are annoying because they make you feel like you tools are working against you. Xcode is a tool. <em>It</em> should serve <em>you</em>. You use that tool to do your job. When your tool seems to be actively trying to thwart you and prevent you from doing your job it can start to rile...</p>\n\n<h3>Some words of praise</h3>\n\n<p>But don&apos;t get me wrong, apart from little faults like this, I love Xcode. With each release it gets faster, more stable, more flexible. Most days it gives me no trouble at all and allows me to manage large and complex projects with aplomb.</p>\n\n<p>And I tip my hat to Apple for making these tools available for free (true, I pay Apple $500 a year for membership in the <a href=\"http://connect.apple.com/\">Apple Developer Connection</a> but anybody can get the tools for free by signing up for a free ADC &quot;Online&quot; account). If they didn&apos;t offer them for free then I never would have decided to try out Project Builder four years ago and learn Cocoa (the result was <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/\">Synergy</a>). In general, both their tools and their documentation are of absolutely outstanding quality. It&apos;s one of the reasons why I can&apos;t stomach the idea of ever switching to Windows and closed, proprietary, non-free tools.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000203more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>There&apos;s an interesting discussion about offering free upgrades &quot;for life&quot;. Slava Karpenko <a href=\"http://www.unsanity.org/archives/000448.php\">started it here</a>, saying that it&apos;s a bad idea:</p>\n\n<blockquote>If you&apos;re a user, sure, free upgrades for life sound great, but come to think of it - if a certain software title promises you that, expect the maker to exit the business or abandon that particular product sooner or later. They simply can&apos;t support themselves and justify adding features when they know they will never get that additional cash in. So why bother making a 2.0 if you know all the hundreds of hours of your hard work are going to be not paid off? I know too many examples of that to count.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Michael Tsai <a href=\"http://mjtsai.com/blog/2006/02/13/lifetime-free-upgrades/\">more or less agrees</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>It&#x2019;s true. I don&#x2019;t like it when I&#x2019;m asked to upgrade every few months or even once a year, but on the other hand if a product claims to include free upgrades forever I also tend to stay away.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Andrew Stone <a href=\"http://www.stone.com/Philosophy\">strongly disagrees</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Be just like the NON-indies - do what they do - charge for your bugs and call it an upgrade. And you still call yourself an INDY? Ok to THIN [sic] different but not BE different</blockquote>\n\n<div id=\"a000207more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>The truth is that I agree with parts of what all three developers say. Here are my thoughts on the &quot;free upgrades for life&quot; question:</p>\n\n<h3>It&apos;s a mistake to offer free upgrades for life</h3>\n\n<p>It&apos;s <em>not</em> going to drive you out of business; there are millions of Mac users out there after all and most of them are connected to the Internet. Even the most wildly successful piece of shareware could never hope to reach &quot;saturation&quot; (where there were no more users left to purchase licenses).</p>\n\n<p>But it&apos;s still a mistake because working for free doesn&apos;t pay the bills. Every free upgrade you offer costs you time, an ever-increasing bandwidth bill as your user base grows, and you have more users to support. Your costs grow exponentially but your income continues to come in linearly. You can survive offering free upgrades but you&apos;ll make more money if you charge for them. And if you make more money then be able to hire more programmers (if you&apos;re a multi-programmer shop) or spend more time on writing the software; it&apos;s a win-win situation because the extra money provides the motivation and the means to deliver better software to the customer.</p>\n\n<h3>Once you&apos;ve made the promise you&apos;ve got to stick by it</h3>\n\n<p>Nothing leaves a fouler taste in one&apos;s mouth than the when you get burnt by a developer who promises free upgrades and later changes policy and starts charging for them. Once you&apos;ve made a statement on the public record like that &#x2014; where it will remain forever preserved in the Google cache, or in the &#x2DD;Wayback machine&quot; at web.archive.org, or most importantly in the minds of your customers &#x2014; you must abide by it.</p>\n\n<p>I made this mistake when I released Synergy in 2002, promising free upgrades for life. I did that because I had no idea it would become what it has become. Since then &#x2014; nearly four years now &#x2014; I&apos;ve been providing free upgrades at the rhythm of about one per month. I know that if I&apos;d not had that upgrade policy that Synergy would be an even better product than it is today (it comes back to what I said above: motivation <em>and</em> means).</p>\n\n<p>There are a small number of Mac developers who have earned places in my mental &quot;Hall of Shame&quot; for making promises and then breaking them, and I will never purchase a license from those companies again, nor will I recommend them to anyone else. Developers like that might rake in a bit of extra cash, but they also burn any good will that they might have built up.</p>\n\n<h3>Do it fairly, don&apos;t get greedy</h3>\n\n<p>In order to strike a balance between increased revenue (motivation and means) and customer satisfaction you need to make sure that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Paid upgrades should be few and far between.</li>\n<li>Paid upgrades should be reasonably priced (not like buying the software all over again).</li>\n<li>Paid upgrades should be <em>major</em> upgrades incorporating new features.</li>\n<li>You should offer a lenient grace period (if a user purchases version 2.0 a couple of weeks before 3.0 comes out he or she most likely won&apos;t be too happy at the idea of being forced to pay for the upgrade); I think that at least 3 and as many as 6 months is about right.\n</li><li>Free upgrades should be often, but not so often as to annoy customers.</li>\n<li>Bug fixes should be free.</li>\n<li>Compatibility updates should be free.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Those latter two points are important. Customers will feel resentful if they are forced to pay for bug fixes (if you sold them the software with bugs in the first place, it is by definition defective and you should therefore not seek to profit from fixing that defect). They&apos;ll also feel resentful if the software won&apos;t run on the next version of Apple&apos;s OS, or Apple&apos;s new hardware, and you try to get money out of them in exchange for working versions. One day it worked, the next day it didn&apos;t: why should they have to pay you again? This is why I&apos;ve offered Universal Binary versions of my applications as free upgrades, even though it cost me money to prepare those versions (the $999 Developer Transition Kit and the $500 ADC membership).</p>\n\n<p>And finally, a comment about new features in paid upgrades: they should be significant, useful new features, not mere window dressing. The worst and most visible offender in this department is probably <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ADBE\">Adobe</a>, which seems to be doing nothing more than churning the money-making handle by offering annual &quot;major&quot; upgrades which contain no meaningful improvements and charging massive upgrade prices for them. Every year we see a new version of Photoshop come out with the version number bumped up by a whole number, the application gets slower and more bloated, but is anything useful really added? There aren&apos;t too many new things that have been added to Photoshop since version 4 (the first I ever saw), yet if you had purchased every upgrade since then you would be literally thousands of dollars out of pocket. Some time ago Adobe stopped being a company that made great software and turned into an money-making machine responsive only to it&apos;s shareholders.</p>\n</div></div>",

This is a tool that I have been using in-house for some time as part of my localization process, but I&apos;ve decided to release it publicly now in preparation for some things to come.</p>\n\n<h3>The things to come...</h3>\n\n<p>I have been thinking about releasing some software under the GPL and in order to do so I have been moving some scripts and tools that I use in my build chain into a special &quot;buildtools&quot; package.

Their license does not allow the distribution of modified source code, but they <em>do</em> allow modified binaries to be distributed provided that you change their name (which is why I named the executable <tt>wincent-strings-util</tt>), and they also allow you to distribute patches, so I&apos;ve done that too.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000208more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Today I released a new product, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/wincent-strings-util/\">Wincent Strings Utility</a> (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2006/02/wincent_strings.php\">full release announcement here</a>). It&apos;s a derivative work of the <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/\">Omni Group&apos;s</a> <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/ftp/pub/localization/\">stringsUtil</a> and I wanted to make a few comments about their license, the <a href=\"http://www.omnigroup.com/developer/sourcecode/sourcelicense/\">Omni Source License</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, although it&apos;s an open source license, it actually makes it very difficult to distribute a derivative work:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You are allowed to distribute verbatim unmodified copies of Omni software at will</li>\n<li>You are allowed to distribute modified binaries</li>\n<li>You are <em>not allowed</em> to distribute modified source</li>\n<li>You are allowed to distribute patches</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It&apos;s that third provision that makes things difficult. In most open source licenses (and certainly in all free software licenses) you are allowed to distribute modified source. In fact, it&apos;s that provision which is central to the whole idea of free software.</p>\n\n<p>In order to comply with their license I&apos;ve had to prepare two kinds of distribution: the modified binary, and a &quot;unmodified source plus patch&quot; archive. I&apos;ve included a couple of scripts that automate the process of preparing and applying the patch but the whole thing definitely feels like a kludge.</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;m also left doubting what the rules for <em>re</em>-distribution are. That is, what happens if someone wants to make a derivative based on my derivative? Must they distribute it as a set of patches against the Omni original source? Against my modified source?

    "html": "<p>Ya.com seems to me to be one of the most unethical and incompetent Internet service providers in Spain and perhaps the world. Add the unpleasantness and difficulty of dealing with them to the mix and you have a recipe for a foul-tasting dish of broadband. My advice: steer as far clear of Ya.com as you can.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000212more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h3>History</h3>\n\n<p>When I moved to my current residence in 2004 I set up an <a href=\"https://acceso.ya.com/\">ADSL connection with Ya.com</a>. I chose them because they offered the fastest plans at that time (4Mb) at a reasonable price (about 75&#x20AC; per month). This price was about double the market-average for ADSL connections at that time, but the speed was about eight times the market-average, so it seemed like a good offer.</p>\n\n<p>I wasn&apos;t happy with the way they set up the connection because they took significantly longer than the promised 30-day maximum, something which was extremely inconvenient because my business model depends on having a good connection to the Internet. And it seemed incredible that a company could take so long to set-up an ADSL connection in a first-world, European nation in the 21st century. They were extremely unresponsive to any attempts at getting the situation resolved, always blaming the incumbent ex-government monopoly tel-co, <a href=\"http://telefonica.es/\">Telef&#xF3;nica</a>. Phone calls and written complaints achieved nothing (other than wasting my time). But that&apos;s water under the bridge now.</p>\n\n<h3>Lack of ethics</h3>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve fulfilled my one-year contract now (many months ago) and so I&apos;m free to move on. I noticed that things have changed since I signed up; their most expensive plan is now only 32,95&#x20AC; + IVA per month (that&apos;s for a 20Mb connection). Yet Ya.com has continued to charge me twice as much for something only one fifth as fast.</p>\n\n<p>So I call Ya.com. They tell me they can&apos;t halve the price because they&apos;ve already doubled my velocity (to 8Mb). This is a common trick of the service providers and it doesn&apos;t strike me as particularly ethical: they try to lock you in at a fixed price despite the fact that market forces act to drive prices downwards over time for a given service. Nevertheless, I thought to myself, I&apos;m negotiating from a position of power; I&apos;ve completed my contract and am free to jump to another service provider whenever I want, so if they screw me, they lose me. Why do they think I&apos;d be happy paying twice the cost of their most expensive advertised plan for something that is not even half as fast? Why would they treat a loyal customer so badly, one that&apos;s fulfilled his contract and has brought considerable revenue into their coffers in the past? Don&apos;t they realize that this kind of treatment leaves a bad taste in people&apos;s mouth?</p>\n\n<h3>Lack of competence</h3>\n\n<p>Perhaps I was wrong to blame Ya.com for lacking ethics. The more I deal with them the more it seems that <em>stupidity</em> is to blame.</p>\n\n<p>When I called them back in November to sort this out they told three contradictory pieces of information in the same phone call:</p>\n\n<h4>1. That my service speed had been doubled to 8Mb and that it couldn&apos;t be lowered</h4>\n\n<p>This was untrue. The service speed was still capped at 4Mb. I know this from the running network tests. I have some corroborating evidence that the consultant was either knowingly or unwittingly deceiving me because the bills I received showed that the service at that time was still 4Mb. (Ya.com later did actually duplicate the service speed, confirmed by network tests and bills, but they did so <em>after</em> I had explicitly requested that they switch me to a &quot;4Mb + calls&quot; plan. With all the phone calls and letters that have been exchanged since then I am not sure what speed my connection actually is; I know they&apos;re charging me for an 8Mb connection but I no longer ever see transfers faster than about 400KB.)</p>\n\n<h4>2. That they didn&apos;t actually offer 8Mb after all</h4>\n\n<p>The consultant then said, &quot;Wait a minute, that can&apos;t be true... we can&apos;t have doubled your velocity to 8Mb because that service isn&apos;t available&quot;. And there was I, wondering why there was no mention of any 8Mb plan on the Ya.com website. She then offered to switch me to the &quot;4Mb plus calls&quot; plan which worked out reasonably enough (about 30&#x20AC; per month with unlimited local and national calls).</p>\n\n<h4>3. That the reduction to 4Mb had been requested and that I should call back later</h4>\n\n<p>She told me she&apos;d requested the reduction to 4Mb (something she had previously said that she &quot;couldn&apos;t do&quot;) but said that the system &quot;gave an error&quot; when she tried to request the addition of calls, so I should call back after receiving my first bill. So here begins the incompetence. &quot;System errors&quot;...</p>\n\n<h4>Locked in the land of 75&#x20AC; ADSL</h4>\n\n<p>Three months passed and I received no bills at all (I normally receive one per month). Then, in one hit I receive a bill with three months on it; and guess what: each month as for an &quot;8Mb ADSL&quot; service, billed at 75&#x20AC; per month.</p>\n\n<p>So the consultant had misinformed me when she said the request to drop to 4Mb had been processed. It hadn&apos;t. On the contrary, this was the first bill where &quot;8Mb&quot; appeared instead of &quot;4Mb&quot;. So exactly the opposite change than the one I had requested had been made!</p>\n\n<p>This time I called again and the incompetence continued. There was no record of my prior phone call or request, said the consultant. Why then, do I see a mysterious reference to a &quot;solicitud de alta&quot; (an application for service) in my online account history on the date that I made the phone call?</p>\n\n<p>She tried to switch me to the &quot;ADSL + calls&quot; plan (three times, she said) and each time got a system error. Who can I speak to that can sort this out? She tells me I have to write a written complaint, and advises me to call back in a week to try again and see if the bugs are ironed out. This time I request a reference number for the phone call.</p>\n\n<p>So I spend an hour of my time (that I would rather use writing code) writing a letter of complaint explaining the history of the situation and asking for things to be sorted out immediately. My main complaints: that Ya.com is charging me more than twice the price of their most expensive offering; that they didn&apos;t switch my plans when they said they would; that on re-requesting that they make the change they inform me that their system is broken; that I&apos;m a good customer (fulfilled the terms of my contract) yet they&apos;re treating me as though I were their worst enemy.  </p>\n\n<p>I called again today: they say there&apos;s no record of having received my complaint yet (glad I used certified mail); that they system still gives them an error; that they&apos;ll try to process the application (to switch to &quot;ADSL + calls&quot;) in written form instead of using their broken computer system.</p>\n\n<p>I find it really hard to believe that a company can treat its customers with such utter contempt. Ya.com&apos;s conduct basically says to me, &quot;We&apos;re morally bankrupt: we are going to screw you as hard as we can for money; and we&apos;re technically bankrupt too: our systems don&apos;t even work properly&quot;. Ya.com could basically have me as a customer for life; just the kind they want: a techie who&apos;s willing to pay a premium for the best connectivity. But instead they seem determined to drive me away to another company. It&apos;s lunacy.</p>\n</div></div>",

You don&apos;t have to collaborate with anyone, download the source or send patches, after all.</p>\n\n<p>The answer is simple; you use version control for the same reason that you do <a href=\"http://test.wincent.com/\">unit testing</a>: to develop more boldly (faster) and produce better (more robust) code.</p>\n\n<p>It allows you to develop fearlessly, make big changes knowing that you can easily back them out and go back to a previous, working version if things don&apos;t turn out. It allows you to quickly compare revisions (which you can visualize using FileMerge) which can help you orient yourself when you&apos;re in the middle of a big change and you want to get a sense of how things are going. It allows you to more easily tag releases or take snapshots at other key moments. It allows you easily work on multiple branches at once (for example, a development branch and a stable/bugfix branch), something that would be extremely awkward without version control. The habit of doing regular check ins (one for each bug fixed, issue addressed or feature added) leads to good coding habits (developing in a more orderly, organized fashion, which in itself should lead to fewer bugs). And it serves as yet another form of backup for the precious data upon which your livelihood depends (although by no means should it be the <em>only</em> kind of backup that you rely on).</p>\n\n<p>If you don&apos;t agree with me, I suggest you try it.

    "file": "content/blog/to-wrap-or-not-to-wrap",
    "html": "<p>For a long, long, long, long time now I&apos;ve hard-wrapped all of my source code to 80 columns. Why might you do this when there is a lot of Objective-C code out there that doesn&apos;t use any limit at all? (examples: <a href=\"http://trac.adiumx.com/browser/trunk/\">Adium</a>, <a href=\"http://bonsai.mozilla.org/rview.cgi?dir=mozilla/camino&amp;cvsroot=/cvsroot&amp;module=default\">Camino</a>, <a href=\"http://project.colloquy.info/trac/browser/trunk\">Colloquy</a>; there are many others). As <a href=\"http://www.sowbug.org/mt/archives/000192.html\">one coder says</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>We&apos;re stocking new engineers with dual 1920x1200 widescreens. That&apos;s the equivalent of six side-by-side VGA screens! In spite of this growth over the years, my basic monitor real-estate coding rules haven&apos;t changed: stay within 80 columns, and try to keep each function short enough to fit vertically on a single screen.</blockquote>\n\n<div id=\"a000217more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h3>Arguments for wrapping</h3>\n\n<p>Most of the arguments for wrapping boil down to the same basic idea: anything you can do to increase the readability of  your code (the ease with which you can take in a slab of code at a glance) is going to help you develop better code (more robust, better designed, less buggy code) and develop it faster.</p>\n\n<h4>Displays the same everywhere</h4>\n\n<p>Because 80 columns is pretty much a &quot;lowest common denominator&quot;, it&apos;s fairly likely that your source code will look the same to everyone, whether they are viewing it in a tiny terminal window or stretched out across a 30&quot; Cinema Display.</p>\n\n<h4>Email</h4>\n\n<p>Code and patches wrapped to 80-columns tend to look pretty good when sent as plaintext email.</p>\n\n<h4>Enforces nesting discipline</h4>\n\n<p>If you start nesting code too many levels deep you&apos;ll find it hard to keep under the 80-column limit. It&apos;s a handy sign that you&apos;re probably nesting too much; if you refactor the code so that it requires fewer levels of nesting it will often be clearer and more readable to others.</p>\n\n<h4>Encourages good variable naming habits</h4>\n\n<p>The 80-column limit is not so strict that you&apos;ll end up labelling all of your variables <tt>i</tt>, <tt>objPtr</tt> and <tt>errPtr</tt>, yet neither is it so liberal that you slip into the bad habit of cooking up variable names like <tt>pointerToPreviouslyInstantiatedSingletonInstance</tt>. Somewhere in the middle between those two extremes you&apos;ll find the readability sweet spot.</p>\n\n<h3>Arguments against wrapping</h3>\n\n<h4>Wrapping to 80 columns can be diffcult</h4>\n\n<p>As much as you might try to find variable names in the &quot;just right&quot; length range you will sometimes be forced to deal with beasts like the <tt>NSPropertyListSerialization</tt> class and you&apos;ll find it very difficult to fit things neatly in an 80-column limit.</p>\n\n<h4>Reformatting can be painful</h4>\n\n<p>If you have edit and re-edit the same block of text many times you may find yourself having to juggle words repeatedly so as to continue sticking to the 80-column limit. This means both reducing line length when lines get too long and increasing line length to use up wasted space when lines get too short.</p>\n\n<p>For this very reason some time ago I introduced an exception into my &quot;80-column rule&quot;. Basically all code and normal comments would still be subject to the limit, but Headerdoc (and later, Doxygen) comments would not be subject to any hard-wrapping at all. I did this because the in-code documentation was just being edited too many times and I was wasting a lot of time worrying about wrapping. The arguments for readability didn&apos;t apply to in-code documentation comments because those would be transformed into HTML anyway by Doxygen.</p>\n\n<h4>Readability can actually suffer</h4>\n\n<p>What&apos;s more readable? This (wrapped to 80 columns)?:</p>\n\n<pre>NSString *executable = \n        [self objectForInfoDictionaryKey:(NSString *)kCFBundleExecutableKey];</pre>\n\n<p>Or this (not wrapped)?:</p>\n\n<pre>NSString *executable = [self objectForInfoDictionaryKey:(NSString *)kCFBundleExecutableKey];</pre>\n\n<h4>80 columns is too small</h4>\n\n<p>Perhaps it&apos;s good to have a non-arbitrary limit, but in this day and age of big screens and high resolutions maybe 80 columns is too small. Perhaps 132 columns would be a good candidate (neither number is entirely arbitrary: historically many terminals have offered 80 and 132-column modes). It seems that this would address some of the main complaints about hard-wrapping without throwing away the readability benefits. Importantly, two 132-column windows can fit comfortably side-by-side on a 23&quot; display.</p>\n\n<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n\n<p>I&apos;m thinking about making the switch to 132-columns. If you have any thoughts on comments on the issue I&apos;d greatly appreciate hearing them (either <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/forums/postlist.php?Cat=0&amp;Board=lounge\">in the forums</a> or <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/contact/mail/\">directly via email</a>).</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>The other day <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/02/clicketyclick.php\">I was lamenting</a> that sometimes I spend far too much time doing non-coding tasks in Xcode when I&apos;d rather be churning out reams of beautifully syntax highlighted, immaculately indented and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/02/to_wrap_or_not.php\">wrapped</a> Objective-C code. Today&apos;s non-coding efforts (requiring a couple of hours) were directed against the infamous &quot;Input/Output Files Dependency Bug&quot;. I say &quot;infamous&quot; because it&apos;s a theme which keeps cropping up on the Xcode Users mailing list.</p>\n\n<h3>The bug</h3>\n\n<p>I use a shell script build phase in many of my projects to automatically update my localizable strings files whenever the underlying source code changes. The basic idea is to watch certain source code files (the &quot;Input Files&quot;) and only run <tt>genstrings</tt> on them when they have newer modification dates than the localizable strings files (the &quot;Output Files&quot;).</p>\n\n<p>The bug is, in short, that &quot;Input/Output Files&quot; don&apos;t work, or if they do, they only work some of the time. The bug manifests itself when Xcode runs shell scripts build phases that it should not be running (given the modification dates of the files), and this causes your build times to grow and it cuts your productivity.</p>\n\n<p>In my experiences, the bug manifests itself in some projects and not in others. It manifests itself some of the time but not always. I tried all of the solutions and addressed all of the possible causes suggested on the<a href=\"http://lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/xcode-users\"> Xcode Users mailing list</a> but none of them worked. My &quot;Input/Output Files&quot; didn&apos;t have any errant newlines trailing them; the files themselves had the correct dates on them and no weirdness (like future dates); I wasn&apos;t using a Jam-based target; the paths as revealed in the environment variables listing of the shell script phases showed that exactly the right paths (absolute ones at that) were being passed to the scripts; and even in projects when the &quot;Input/Output Files&quot; checking did seem to be working correctly the dependency information wasn&apos;t shared across Debug and Release build styles at all (that is, even if the shell script was correctly skipped in the Debug build, it would always run in the Release build the first time you did it).</p>\n\n<p>In short, the behavior is entirely inconsistent, utterly baffling, and annoying. It may be that Xcode didn&apos;t like the fact that both my Input <em>and</em> my Output Files were in the <tt>${SOURCE_ROOT}</tt> (rather than the latter being in the <tt>${DERIVED_FILE_DIR}</tt>) but even if that&apos;s the case it&apos;s still a bug.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000218more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h3>The workaround</h3>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve actually <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/02/two_annoying_xc.php\">written about this little bug before</a>. About 9 days ago I implemented a workaround that functioned perfectly but which still struck me as an ugly kludge: I had my shell script check the modification dates and do the comparison that Xcode seemingly couldn&apos;t do itself.</p>\n\n<p>Today, sick of checking my shell scripts in various projects for ones which mysteriously worked and others which didn&apos;t, I stumbled across the already-mentioned environment variables which pass Input and Output Files to shell scripts. This meant I could throw out my hard-coded kludge and replace it with a generic script that reads those environment variables and does the comparison. Its output looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre>Checking modification date for input file WOCrashReporterController.m: 1140846008\nChecking modification date for input file Localization.languages: 1114780373\nChecking modification date for output file en.lproj/Localizable.strings: 1140879075\nNewest input file is not newer than oldest output file: returning 0</pre>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve trimmed the output a little so that it fits more easily into a browser window (here relative paths are shown but the real thing shows absolute paths). So the example above shows a comparison which shows the input files are older than the output file. Below is an example of a comparison which shows the opposite.</p>\n\n<pre>Checking modification date for input file WOCrashReporterController.m: 1140882973\nChecking modification date for input file Localization.languages: 1114780373\nChecking modification date for output file en.lproj/Localizable.strings: 1140879075\nNewest input file is newer than oldest output file: returning 1</pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, if the files need updating then the script returns 1; otherwise it returns 0. It can be used like this:</p>\n\n<pre>. &quot;${BUILDTOOLS_DIR}/CheckInputOutputFiles.sh&quot; || \\\n    . &quot;${BUILDTOOLS_DIR}/UpdateStringsFiles.sh&quot; &quot;${SOURCE_ROOT}/WOCrashReporter&quot; en\n<br>\nexit 0</pre>\n\n<p>Notice the use of the <tt>||</tt> operator: if <tt>CheckInputOutputFiles.sh</tt> returns 0 then no action is taken. If it returns 1 then the second script, <tt>UpdateStringsFiles.sh</tt> is run.</p>\n\n<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n\n<p>Xcode (and before it, Project Builder) has a long history of dependency related bugs but it&apos;s really no surprise considering the hideous complexity of the task. On the whole Xcode does pretty well. And with each release Apple generally makes things a little better. The pleasure of setting up target-level dependencies by dragging-and-dropping pretty icons in the Xcode GUI is a dream beyond the wildest imaginings of the people who originally wrote <tt>make</tt>. Nevertheless, this &quot;Input/Output File&quot; issue has been a problem for as long as I can remember using it.</p>\n\n<p>This is a classic example of an attempt at saving time ends up backfiring. Here I had an automated process in place that was designed to keep my localized strings files up to date. In reality the automation didn&apos;t work, it has slowed down hundreds of builds, and I&apos;ve ended up having to implement a workaround. From now on hopefully it <em>will</em> save me time.</p>\n\n<p>In situations like this, do you file a bug report with Apple? They&apos;ll probably want a test case: what do I do? Zip up my entire proprietary source tree and send it to them? And then do I have to check to see if it&apos;s fixed (or broken) in every new Xcode release that they do? Seeing as I&apos;ve already got a robust and relatively elegant workaround, I think I&apos;ll just leave this one as it is and get back to working on my own products...</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<h3>Existing paradigms</h3>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve spent a day now coming up with a neat way of implementing a particular inter-thread communication paradigm. The most common thread paradigm is the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>The main thread spawns a worker thread to handle long-running processing tasks in the background. While the worker thread is labouring away the main thread keeps the user interface responsive for the user. When the worker thread is done it notifies the main thread.</blockquote>\n\n<p>A popular variation on this paradigm is this one:</p>\n\n<blockquote>The main thread again employs a worker thread, but this time the main thread has the ability to send messages to the worker thread while the latter continues to run (for example, a &quot;cancel&quot; message could be used to tell the worker thread to stop processing and perform cleanup).</blockquote>\n\n<p>Compare these with the single threaded-paradigm:</p>\n\n<blockquote>The main thread handles all the work itself; if a task is long running then the user interface may become unresponsive until the task is completed.</blockquote>\n\n<p>This last paradigm is probably the fastest because it avoids thread-associated overheads. It is also the easiest to implement because it does not require the developer to worry about resource contention between threads, nor is there any need to implement methods to handle callback notifications.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically this paradigm (the fastest) may <em>seem</em> to be the slowest because of the UI responsiveness issues. If the user sees the &quot;spinning beachball of death&quot; then he or she may think the program has hung (entered an infinite loop) even though the program is working away. For this reason &quot;beachballs&quot; should be avoided at all costs, and that&apos;s why you sometimes have to go down a multi-threaded path even though you might prefer not to.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000230more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h3>A new paradigm</h3>\n\n<p>I began to wonder if there was a way of blending these paradigms into something new, something that would be better for the particular set of problems I am trying to solve in my work on <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a>. I don&apos;t claim to have invented this design pattern but it&apos;s not something I&apos;ve seen before. The basic idea can be broken up as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>The main thread spawns a worker thread to handle potentially long-running tasks.</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, the beachball issue is taken care of. But let&apos;s add a nuance:</p>\n\n<blockquote>The main thread will block and wait for the worker thread to finish its task, but it will only block for a short period (say, one or two seconds) so as to avoid the appearance of the dreaded beachball.</blockquote>\n\n<p>What this means is that we still maintain the appearance of a responsive UI (no beachballs) but we gain some of the simplicity of what we had in the single-threaded approach (a linear flow of execution).</p>\n\n<blockquote>In the case that the worker thread takes too long, the main thread unblocks. When the worker thread is done it will notify the main thread.</blockquote>\n\n<p>So now we are back in the world of multi-threaded programming again. The main thread will maintain UI responsiveness while the worker thread labours in the background. The main thread will also receive notification once the worker thread is done.</p>\n\n<p>This is the method that I&apos;ve come up with to implement this pattern:</p>\n\n<pre>+ (BOOL)detatchNewThreadInvocation:(NSInvocation *)invocation\n                              wait:(NSTimeInterval)interval\n                          callback:(id)target\n                          selector:(SEL)selector</pre>\n\n<p>Observations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It&apos;s provided in a category on <tt>NSThread</tt> for ease of use.</li>\n<li>The pattern should be familiar to anyone who has used Cocoa&apos;s <tt>detachNewThreadSelector:toTarget:withObject:</tt>.</li>\n<li>I use <tt>NSInvocation</tt> as it allows me to neatly encapsulate the target, selector, arguments and return value.</li>\n<li>If <tt>interval</tt> is zero the calling thread won&apos;t wait/block at all.</li>\n<li>If <tt>target</tt> is zero then no callback will take place.</li>\n<li>Returns YES if the thread returned before the time limit was reached (in which case the caller knows there&apos;s no need to expect a callback).</li>\n<li>Returns NO if the thread did not return before the time limit (in which case the caller knows whether to expect a callback).</li>\n<li>The callback method should accept a single argument of type <tt>NSInvocation</tt>; it will be passed the original invocation.</li>\n<li>The method can be called from any thread, not just the main thread.</li>\n<li>No ugly kludges or inefficient techniques required (polling, spinlocks).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All in all I am fairly happy with the design and I think it will help me to make some very nice code. Basically, this is ideal for Apple Event communication between Synergy Advance and iTunes; most of the time iTunes responds to Apple Events almost immediately, but at other times (for example, when you have the preferences window open) it will delay for extremely long periods. This method allows me to use a simple communications model most of the time but fall back to the more complicated (multi-threaded/callback) model when required.</p>\n\n<p>My next step is to serialize this (there&apos;s no good argument for having multiple threads communicating with iTunes at once; it will be much better to have a single worker thread handle all communication using a one-at-a-time queuing model) but it should be fairly easy now that I&apos;ve written the <tt>WOQueue</tt> class.</p>\n</div></div>",

Today I&apos;ve been working on <tt>WOQueueConsumer</tt>, which is designed to eliminate some of the repetitive work you would otherwise have to do every time you make use of such a queue.</p>\n\n<h3>Consumer/producer models</h3>\n\n<p>There are number of possible consumer/producer models in single and multi-threaded programming:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Single-threaded:</strong> the only thread is both a producer (adding items to the queue) and a consumer (removing items from the queue).</li>\n<li><strong>Mutli-threaded, single producer/multiple consumers:</strong> a single thread adds items to the queue (perhaps driven by the user interface or read from the disk or the network) and multiple worker threads are spawned as consumers (removing items from the queue).</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-threaded, single producer/single consumer:</strong> a single thread (such as the main thread) is responsible for adding items to the queue and there is a single worker thread in the background acting as a consumer (removing items from the queue).</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-threaded, multiple producers/single consumer:</strong> multiple threads add items to the queue (producers) but only one thread acts a consumer (removing items from the queue).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Yesterday I <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/03/threading_nicet.php\">wrote about my threading work</a> on <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> and commented:</p>\n\n<blockquote>My next step is to serialize this (there&apos;s no good argument for having multiple threads communicating with iTunes at once; it will be much better to have a single worker thread handle all communication using a one-at-a-time queuing model) but it should be fairly easy now that I&apos;ve written the WOQueue class.</blockquote>\n\n<p>So this is a case where we need a single consumer (model 3 above), and there may potentially be multiple producers (model 4). <tt>WOQueueConsumer</tt> implements model 4, but given that model 4 is a superset of model 3 it can be used for the latter as well. In practice I believe that most of my use will be based on model 3 because the need to communicate with iTunes most often comes from the main thread only (either user-driven interaction with the user interface, or timer-driven interaction such as the heart-beat which also occurs on the main thread).</p>\n\n<p>The idea is that <tt>WOQueueConsumer</tt> implements and neatly encapsulates all the things you usually would need to do when working with a <tt>WOQueue</tt>. You just write a subclass and override the <tt>- (void)processQueueItem:(id)item</tt> method and you&apos;re done.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000231more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h3>And tangentially...</h3>\n\n<p>One of the things I like most about programming is that you&apos;re constantly forced to learn new things. Rather than repeatedly solving problems you&apos;ve already solved in the past you&apos;re exposed to new problems and must acquire new knowledge in order to solve them.</p>\n\n<p>When you first start learning Cocoa you very quickly run into <tt>NSString</tt>, <tt>NSDictionary</tt>, <tt>NSLog</tt> and friends. Then sooner or later you&apos;ll need to learn about <tt>NSView</tt>, <tt>NSButton</tt>, <tt>NSWindow</tt>; maybe you need to delve into <tt>NSControl</tt> and <tt>NSResponder</tt> too.</p>\n\n<p>At some point you&apos;ll need to parse a string and you&apos;ll find out about a thing called <tt>NSScanner</tt>. You&apos;ll need to work with files (<tt>NSWorkspace</tt>, <tt>NSFileManager</tt>). You&apos;ll discover <tt>NSNotification</tt> and <tt>NSNotificationCenter</tt>.</p>\n\n<p>Then Apple will introduce a new technology like Cocoa Bindings or Core Data and you&apos;ll have something completely new to learn. Or you&apos;ll find that what you want to do can&apos;t be done from within Cocoa so you have to dip into Carbon, Core Foundation, Mach or the POSIX layer.</p>\n\n<p>You&apos;ll go on to learn about threads, kernel queues, Mach dead-name notifications, memory barriers, mutexes, public-key cryptography, digests, signatures. If you&apos;re really unlucky you&apos;ll have to grapple with field editors and <tt>NSCell</tt> subclasses. There are literally hundreds of classes available to you in the Cocoa frameworks and one by one you&apos;ll end up learning and using them.</p>\n\n<p>The reason I&apos;m writing all this is that my work on <tt>WOQueueConsumer</tt> and friends has yet again put me in the learning zone where I end up using Cocoa classes that I&apos;d never touched before (like <tt>NSConnection</tt>, <tt>NSPort</tt> and <tt>NSNotificationQueue</tt>). It&apos;s all good fun: keeps the job interesting.</p>\n</div></div>",

This is a question that I was asking myself earlier this evening.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000236more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h3>The results</h3>\n\n<p>Given a method:</p>\n\n<pre>- (void)testMethod1:(NSString *)something, ...</pre>\n\n<p>The following statement:</p>\n\n<pre>NSLog(@&quot;%@&quot;, [TestClass instanceMethodSignatureForSelector:@selector(testMethod1:)]);</pre>\n\n<p>Prints (timestamp, process name and ID omitted for brevity):</p>\n\n<pre>NSMethodSignature: types=v@:@ nargs=3 sizeOfParams=160 returnValueLength=0;</pre>\n    \nThis method:\n\n<pre>- (void)testMethod2:(NSString *)something otherThing:(id)thing</pre>\n\n<p>Prints:</p>\n\n<pre>NSMethodSignature: types=v@:@@ nargs=4 sizeOfParams=160 returnValueLength=0;</pre> \n    \nAnd this one:\n\n<pre>- (void)testMethod3:(NSString *)something</pre>\n\n<p>Prints:</p>\n\n<pre>NSMethodSignature: types=v@:@ nargs=3 sizeOfParams=160 returnValueLength=0;</pre>\n\n<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n\n<p>Methods that take variable numbers of arguments appear no different to the runtime than methods which do not (note that <tt>testMethod1</tt> and <tt>testMethod3</tt> have the same signature). This means that you can&apos;t use <tt>NSInvocation</tt> to represent invocations of methods which take multiple arguments (if you try to call <tt>setArgument:atIndex:</tt> for the additional arguments an exception will be raised). It also means that my mock object implementation in the <a href=\"http://test.wincent.com/\">WOTest framework</a>  won&apos;t work properly with such methods (it simply won&apos;t &quot;see&quot; the additional arguments). And finally, it means that I have to refactor some of my code (methods which take variable numbers of arguments) if I want to use it with <tt>NSInvocation</tt> (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/03/threading_nicet.php\">and I do</a>).</p>\n\n<p>What kind of refactoring? Basically you have to do the same as Apple has done with functions like <tt>NSLog</tt> and <tt>NSLogv</tt>. One takes a variable number of arguments and the other takes a <tt>va_list</tt> as its last parameter. To avoid code duplication you can have the first form prepare the <tt>va_list</tt> and invoke the other.</p>\n\n<p>And yes, the fact that <tt>NSInvocation</tt> does not support methods with a variable number of arguments <em>is</em> noted in the documentation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>NSInvocation does not support invocations of methods with either variable numbers of arguments or union arguments.</blockquote>\n\n<p>But I didn&apos;t notice that until after I&apos;d scaled the little learning curve described in this article.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Today I present an episode in the Great Mysteries of Cocoa series.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000239more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h3>The mystery</h3>\n\n<p>Set up an <tt>NSConnection</tt> like this:</p>\n\n<pre>[NSConnection connectionWithReceivePort:[NSPort port] sendPort:[NSPort port]];</pre>\n\n<p>Pass that connection to another thread as <tt>remoteConnection</tt>. Now try to create a local connection, <tt>localConnection</tt> in the thread based on the passed connection:</p>\n\n<pre>[NSConnection connectionWithReceivePort:[remoteConnection sendPort]\n                               sendPort:[remoteConnection receivePort]];</pre>\n\n<p>If you try to use that connection you&apos;ll find that your code blocks forever as soon as you try to perform <tt>[localConnection rootProxy]</tt>. Pass the ports separately instead of passing the connection and the code works as expected without blocking. This is why the Apple example code gets you to pass not only the connection but the ports separately (in an array), even though it seems like an unnecessarily long-winded way of doing things.</p>\n\n<p>Still, I can&apos;t say that I really like the behaviour. Consider the following piece of code:</p>\n\n<pre>NSPort *port1 = [NSPort port];\nNSPort *port2 = [NSPort port];\nNSConnection *connection =\n    [NSConnection connectionWithReceivePort:port1 sendPort:port2];\nNSPort *port3 = [connection receivePort];   // does port3 == port1?\nNSPort *port4 = [connection sendPort];      // does port4 == port2?</pre>\n\n<p>Is <tt>NSConnection</tt> returning the ports that were used to create it? If not, it definitely seems counter-intuitive given that the documentation says that <tt>receivePort</tt>, &quot;Returns the NSPort on which the receiver receives incoming network messages.&quot; But the docs also go on to say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>You can inspect this object for debugging purposes or use it to create another NSConnection, but shouldn&#x2019;t use it to send or receive messages explicitly.</blockquote>\n\n<p>So does <tt>port1</tt> equal <tt>port3</tt> or not? I whipped up a quick test project and found out that it is indeed equal (both according to a pointer comparison and also the <tt>isEqual:</tt> method). It&apos;s equal if you perform the comparisons from the same thread, and also if you perform them from a secondary thread after passing the <tt>NSConnection</tt> to that thread. So the question is, why does the call to <tt>rootProxy</tt> block if you don&apos;t pass the ports separately? I&apos;m afraid it will have to remain one of the Great Mysteries of Cocoa...</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Yesterday I was working on getting <a href=\"http://winswitch.wincent.com/\">WinSwitch</a> up and running as a Universal Binary. One of the hold-ups has been that a couple of the frameworks that WinSwitch depends on, WOBezel and WOHotKey, have been under heavy development as part of my work on <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a>. This required some changes to WinSwitch to get the whole thing back into a buildable state.</p>\n\n<p>One of the things that was broken was that I had refactored some classes in WOBezel. What used to be <tt>WOBezelWindow</tt> was now <tt>WOAlertBezelWindow</tt> and I had to update my nib files. But when I tried to open my nib files Interface Builder refused to open them because it couldn&apos;t unarchive the instances of <tt>WOHotKeyCaptureView</tt> in the nibs.</p>\n\n<p>So it was time to get my WOHotKey Interface Builder palette working again, as well as the installable variants of my WOHotKey, WOBezel, WODebug and WOTest frameworks (these were previously broken in one of the many Xcode upgrades that have taken place since the last time I made changes to those nib files).</p>\n\n<h3>Embedded vs Installable</h3>\n\n<p>In general I create all my frameworks as embedded frameworks for the following reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>All-in-one packages are easier to distribute (no need for an installer).</li>\n<li>There&apos;s no possibility of a version mismatch between an application and older, installed frameworks.</li>\n<li>The diskspace and bandwidth overheads are negligible in this day of cheap, massive hard disks and widespread broadband access.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But the trouble with embedded frameworks is that they require you to hardwire their install path to <tt>@executable_path/../Frameworks</tt>. Because of the hard-wiring you can&apos;t move those frameworks somewhere else (such as <tt>/Library/Frameworks/</tt>) and expect them to work. There <em>is</em> the new <tt>@loader_path</tt> macro which affords some flexibility but that only works on 10.4 and so it&apos;s not suitable for use with my frameworks (which at the time of writing must all run on 10.3 as well).</p>\n\n<p>So in the past I&apos;ve gotten around this problem by having two separate targets in each of my framework projects: one for the embedded version and one for the installed version. This sucked because it was yet another thing to worry about keeping in synch; if I made a change to one target I&apos;d have to remember to make a change to the other. It also doubled the effective build time if I wanted to build both the embeddable and installable variants of a framework.</p>\n\n<p>But that wasn&apos;t the only reason it was bad. I also had a bit of trouble with Xcode&apos;s <tt>DSTROOT</tt> build setting. Xcode has this to say about <tt>DSTROOT</tt>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>The path at which all products will be rooted when performing an install build.  For instance, to install your products on the system proper, set this path to &apos;/&apos;.  Defaults to /tmp/$(PROJECT_NAME).dst to prevent a &quot;test&quot; install build from accidentally overwriting valid and needed data in the ultimate install path.<br>\n<br>\nTypically this path is not set per target, but is provided as an option on the command line when performing an &apos;xcodebuild install&apos;.  It may also be set in a build configuration in special circumstances.  [DSTROOT]</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, reading this I said to myself, why not set it per-target? What&apos;s the difference between setting it per-target and passing it on the command line? Apple&apos;s Scott Tooker provides <a href=\"http://lists.apple.com/archives/xcode-users/2004/Jan/msg00534.html\">this clarification</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>The idea is that by default, when &quot;installing&quot; a build that the products go into a separate location where you can verify the contents before dittoing or copying the result into place (since a bad framework could seriously hose your system). Another benefit of installing into a separate location is this gives you a sparse root that can be turned into a package for distribution.<br>\n<br>\nBy default this separate location is set to be /tmp (the build setting that controls this is $DSTROOT). Currently there is no UI for $DSTROOT. Although we don&apos;t recommend it, you can set DSTROOT to &quot;/&quot; to have things install in place.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Until I understood this I was setting my installable frameworks to be installed in <tt>/Library/Frameworks/</tt>. This had a number of undesirable side-effects:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It&apos;s not just that the products were being <em>installed</em> there, they were actually being <em>built</em> there; this means that a failed build would cause a previous, working version of the framework to be damaged or overwritten.</li>\n<li>In many cases doing a &quot;Clean All&quot; would remove installed versions of all your frameworks, which can wreak havoc if you have applications running that depend on those frameworks (Interface Builder, for example).</li>\n<li>Xcode puts a symbolic link to the installed framework in the <tt>TARGET_BUILD_DIR</tt>, thus making it impossible to have both an embeddable version in your <tt>TARGET_BUILD_DIR</tt> and an installed version in your <tt>/Library/Frameworks/</tt> directory.</li>\n<li>Xcode had a lot of trouble find private headers for installed frameworks (which I like to store in my <tt>TARGET_BUILD_DIR</tt> rather than in inside the framework itself so that I don&apos;t have to worry about stripping them out before shipping the framework to users).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So what&apos;s the point of using <tt>DSTROOT</tt> if it brings all these problems with it? How is it better than merely copying the framework into place yourself using a shell script build phase? It seemed to me that the only reason you would use it is if you needed &quot;sparse root that can be turned into a package for distribution&quot;, and that didn&apos;t apply to me.</p>\n\n<h3><tt>install_name_tool</tt> to the rescue</h3>\n\n<p>When I finally understood this I set about creating new aggregate targets in my framework projects for the purposes of creating installable variants. Aggregate targets are wonderful in this case because you can leverage the work already done in setting up the embeddable version of the framework: no need to keep two targets in synch with each other, no need to double your build times if you want to build both variants of the framework.</p>\n\n<p>But that leaves the <tt>@executable_path</tt> problem to solve. This information was hard-coded in my frameworks and would render them inoperative once installed. This is where <tt>install_name_tool</tt> comes to the rescue. You can use it to change the install name of a framework and also the names of the dynamic shared libraries it depends on. Instead of building an entirely new version of the framework for installation purposes, your shell script merely copies it into place and then uses <tt>install_name_tool</tt> to massage it into shape (see the man page for <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/install_name_tool.1.html\">more information</a>). Package all this into a reusable shell script and you&apos;re laughing.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously this is much, much faster than building a whole new version of the framework. It also neatly sidesteps all the problems mentioned above: there are no troublesome symbolic links left in your <tt>TARGET_BUILD_DIR</tt>, Xcode has no trouble finding private header files, and the frameworks are only copied into place (overwriting previously installed versions) if the build completes successfully so you won&apos;t have any problems &quot;pulling the rug out from under&quot; running applications.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000243more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h3>The last remaining problem to solve...</h3>\n\n<p>With this change I am very happy with my build process. If you&apos;ve been reading this weblog with any regularity you&apos;ll see that over the past few weeks I&apos;ve been <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/02/xcode_inputoutp.php\">working hard at addressing</a> <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/02/two_annoying_xc.php\">bugs in Xcode&apos;s Input/Output Files functionality</a>, reducing excessive build times caused by <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/01/embedding_build.php\">automatic build number embedding</a>, implementing a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/02/xcode_feature_r.php\">home-made version of <tt>InfoPlist.strings</tt> file preprocessing</a>, rolling out a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/01/build_setting_i.php\">configuration file</a> infrastructure across all my projects, and converting many, many dependent sub-projects into mere targets within their parent projects (for less overhead, faster builds, better dependency analysis, easier management and better searchability). </p>\n\n<p>As a result of all this work my builds are faster than ever, more deterministic and reliable, and my maintenance load is way down. I&apos;ve been rolling as much useful stuff as possible into my &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2006/02/wincent_strings.php\">buildtools</a>&quot; tool set. I&apos;ve finally achieved the holy grail of version numbering: the ability to set the version number in a single place and have it propagate everywhere it&apos;s needed (the <tt>Info.plist</tt> and all <tt>InfoPlist.strings</tt> files, and embedded in the application itself in places like the &quot;About&quot; box and visible on the command line via the <tt>what</tt> tool).</p>\n\n<p>All of this has required literally weeks of work, but the long-term benefits will be obvious. From here on it will be much less time spent doing <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/02/clicketyclick.php\">the clickety-click dance in Xcode</a> and waiting for builds to complete, and more time spent coding! There are currently no major Xcode bugs which are draining my productivity because I&apos;ve implemented satisfactory workarounds in all cases. (There <em>are</em> still <em>minor</em> productivity-draining bugs, but I&apos;ve filed bug reports, they&apos;ve been marked as duplicates, and I am confident that Apple will eliminate them in the not-too-distant future.)</p>\n\n<p>There is now only one last remaining problem to solve: how to integrate the automatic production of unstripped release builds in the build process. At the moment I have two configurations, &quot;Debug&quot; and &quot;Release&quot;. The &quot;Debug&quot; builds are gigantic because they contain an immense quantity of symbols. These cannot be shipped to customers due to their size; they may also be slower, and they are more vulnerable to reverse engineering. The &quot;Release&quot; builds are slim because the symbols have been stripped but the stripping makes crash reports hard to read.</p>\n\n<p>Consider this report:</p>\n\n<pre>Thread 0 Crashed:\n0   com.apple.Foundation       \t0x92902340 _NSRaiseError + 264\n1   com.apple.Foundation       \t0x929b36e0 -[NSAssertionHandler handleFailureInMethod:object:file:lineNumber:description:] + 112\n2   com.wincent.WOBase         \t0xc80021fc 0xc8000000 + 8700\n3   libobjc.A.dylib            \t0x909c0568 call_class_loads + 164\n4   libobjc.A.dylib            \t0x909c047c call_load_methods + 124\n5   libobjc.A.dylib            \t0x909bb2e8 map_images + 760\n6   dyld                       \t0x8fe0f8b4 ImageLoaderMachO::doNotification(dyld_image_mode, unsigned, dyld_image_info const*) + 108\n7   dyld                       \t0x8fe03a38 dyld::notifyAdding(std::vector&lt;ImageLoader*, std::allocator&lt;ImageLoader*&gt; &gt;&amp;) + 260\n8   dyld                       \t0x8fe0d8f4 ImageLoader::runInitializers(ImageLoader::LinkContext const&amp;) + 80\n9   dyld                       \t0x8fe030a0 dyld::initializeMainExecutable() + 92\n10  com.wincent.SynergyAdvance \t0x00007c2c 0x1000 + 27692\n11  com.wincent.SynergyAdvance \t0x00007a28 0x1000 + 27176\n12  dyld                       \t0x8fe01048 _dyld_start + 60</pre>\n\n<p>You&apos;ll notice that in frame 2 (inside the WOBase framework) and frames 10 and 11 (inside Synergy Advance itself) there is no human-readable symbol information, just numeric addresses.

If you set up your build environment correctly, you can ship a program with export-only symbols to your users and still be able to map addresses in a crash log to their symbolic names.</blockquote>\n\n<p>So my current task is to work out what the best way is to make the production of non-stripped release builds occur in an automatic fashion. In the past I had a separate build style (in addition to &quot;Debug&quot; and &quot;Release&quot;); call it &quot;Release+symbols&quot; or &quot;Release-no-strip&quot; or &quot;Release (unstripped)&quot;, whatever takes your fancy. I&apos;ve made so many changes to my build chain lately that these old styles no longer work so I&apos;ll have to start again from scratch.</p>\n\n<p>Most likely I&apos;ll have to turn off linker support for symbol stripping and instead perform stripping in a separate shell script build phase using the <tt>strip</tt> tool. But as Apple&apos;s Eric Albert <a href=\"http://lists.apple.com/archives/Xcode-users/2005/Nov/msg00588.html\">notes</a>, this will probably produce slightly different results:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Symbol stripping with strip is different from symbol stripping at link time.  In particular, the linker has additional information about the layout of your executable that strip doesn&apos;t have, so it can strip slightly more.</blockquote>\n\n<p>So will report back here if I gain any useful insights while working on the problem.</p>\n\n<p>[<strong>Update:</strong> <em>22 March 2006</em>; <a href=\"http://www.55ware.com/about-andy.html\">Andy O&apos;Meara</a> (of <a href=\"http://www.55ware.com/g-force/index.html\">G-Force</a> fame) has made an <a href=\"http://lists.apple.com/archives/Xcode-users/2006/Mar/msg00552.html\">interesting post</a> to the <a href=\"http://lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/xcode-users\">Xcode users mailing list</a> about his own approach to tackling this problem.]</p>\n</div></div>",

It <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2005/11/some_words_of_p.php\">hasn&apos;t skipped a beat</a> since then (218 days of uptime with incredibly solid network connectivity) but it was nevertheless time to perform a kernel upgrade so as to pull down the latest security fixes from <a href=\"http://www.redhat.com/\">Red Hat</a>.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000244more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h3>How it works</h3>\n\n<p>As part of the <a href=\"https://rhn.redhat.com/help/about.pxt\">Red Hat Network</a> you get automated security updates on a daily basis. Since switching to Rackspace I&apos;ve received daily email reports informing me of automated updates applied to <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/\">Apache</a>, <a href=\"http://www.php.net/\">PHP</a> and many other pieces of software on the server. These may not be the bleeding-edge latest versions of the software, but Red Hat makes a point of back-porting security fixes.</p>\n\n<p>Yet for some time now my daily email reports have ended with this:</p>\n\n<pre>The following Packages were marked to be skipped by your configuration:<br>\n<br>\nName                                    Version        Rel  Reason\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nkernel                                  2.4.21         37.0.1.ELPkg name/pattern\nkernel-doc                              2.4.21         37.0.1.ELPkg name/pattern\nkernel-source                           2.4.21         37.0.1.ELPkg name/pattern\nredhat-release                          3ES            13.6.2Config modified<br>\n<br>\nAll packages are currently up to date</pre>\n\n<p>I presumed that Rackspace, in their wisdom, didn&apos;t automatically apply kernel updates because they may prove disruptive. Perhaps they only apply them for particularly critical vulnerabilities. But today I saw an article in their knowledge base stating that kernel updates are skipped in the default configuration for <tt>up2date</tt>; that is, you&apos;ll never ever get a kernel update unless you do it yourself (or ask them to do it for you; most probably for free).</p>\n\n<h3>How to upgrade the kernel</h3>\n\n<p>It turns out that it couldn&apos;t be easier. Back in my FreeBSD days when I upgraded the kernel I built it myself and then installed it. With RedHat it&apos;s a simple matter of doing:</p>\n\n<pre>sudo up2date -uf kernel kernel-source kernel-doc</pre>\n\n<p>The kernel is downloaded, unpacked and installed. That&apos;s all you have to do. When you&apos;re ready, reboot to start using the new kernel:</p>\n\n<pre>sudo reboot</pre>\n\n<p>This is without a doubt the quickest and most painless kernel upgrade I&apos;ve ever done. By looking at the timestamps in entries in <tt>/var/log/boot.log</tt> and <tt>/var/log/messages</tt> I can see that precisely 92 seconds elapsed between Apache shutting down and starting up again. <a href=\"http://sendmail.org/\">Sendmail</a> was down for 87 seconds. </p>\n\n<h3>Preflight</h3>\n\n<p>Of course, being the cautious fellow I am I didn&apos;t just run <tt>up2date</tt> and forget about it. I also did a number of &quot;preflight&quot; and &quot;postflight&quot; checks to make sure that everything worked as it should.</p>\n\n<pre>$ uptime\n 18:48:27  up 218 days,  6:37,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00\n$ cat /etc/redhat-release\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux ES release 3 (Taroon Update 5)\n$ uname -a\nLinux s69819.wincent.com 2.4.21-32.0.1.EL #1 Tue May 17 17:55:54 EDT 2005 i686 athlon i386 GNU/Linux</pre>\n\n<p>I looked in <tt>/boot/</tt> to make sure that the kernel files were correctly installed, and confirmed that the appropriate modifications to <tt>/boot/grub/grub.conf</tt> had been made. I also did a <tt>sudo up2date -uf redhat-release</tt> after looking at exactly what files were included in the &quot;redhat-release&quot; package and determining that doing the update wouldn&apos;t break anything.</p>\n\n<h3>Postflight</h3>\n\n<pre>$ uptime\n 19:23:01  up 2 min,  3 users,  load average: 0.12, 0.13, 0.06\n$ cat /etc/redhat-release\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux ES release 3 (Taroon Update 6)\n$ uname -a\nLinux s69819.wincent.com 2.4.21-37.0.1.EL #1 Wed Jan 11 18:43:39 EST 2006 i686 athlon i386 GNU/Linux</pre>\n\n<p>I did a <tt>sudo service --status-all</tt> and to my surprise saw that <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html\">Mailman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.clamav.net/\">clamd</a> were not running. A <tt>sudo chkconfig --list</tt> revealed that they were not set to launch at boot time. The problem was that I had done the following when I configured them for the first time:</p>\n\n<pre>$ sudo service mailman start\n$ sudo chkconfig --add mailman</pre>\n\n<p>But had failed to do:</p>\n\n<pre>$ sudo chkconfig mailman on</pre>\n\n<p>It turns out that even though <tt>clamd</tt> was not running for a few minutes it didn&apos;t prevent mail delivery during that time. Mailman was even less of a worry given the amount of traffic on my <a href=\"http://lists.wincent.com/\">mailing lists</a>. So all in all I am very happy with the upgrade and will apply any other kernel updates in the future</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Have just spent about six hours trying to track down a bug in my code that was causing a crash in <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a>. Turns out that it wasn&apos;t a bug in my code at all, rather it was a misunderstanding of the way <tt>NSConnection</tt> works. I was using an <tt>NSConnection</tt> to communicate between threads, passing a pointer to an <tt>NSInvocation</tt> from one thread to another. The receiving thread was testing for pointer equality prompting my assertion to fail. The reason I spent so much time before finding the cause is that I assumed it was an error in my code; it wasn&apos;t until the very end that I decided to test my assumptions about the way Cocoa works...</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that because <tt>NSConnection</tt> uses <tt>NSDistantObject</tt>, a subclass of <tt>NSProxy</tt>, to do the communication it wasn&apos;t just passing my pointer; it was actually creating a new <tt>NSInvocation</tt> on the fly, and passing a pointer to that object! I guess I should have known this if I&apos;d&apos;ve had more experience with distributed objects. A painful and frustrating lesson, nonetheless. I guess I&apos;m a little surprised that it works this way; I can easily handle thread-safe access to the object, all I want to do is perform a pointer comparison!</p>\n\n<p>So the &quot;solution&quot; is to pass something else. My first attempt was to pass an <tt>NSValue</tt> object containing the pointer, but that causes causes an <tt>NSInvalidArgumentException</tt> (cannot encode (void *) value: &lt;170ff900 &gt;). Seems like the way to go will be to use <tt>NSNumber</tt> to represent the pointer... Unbelievable.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, once you&apos;ve learned (the hard way, using the debugger) that this is the way <tt>NSConnection</tt> works, you quickly find some explanation in the documentation. In the description for the <tt>rootProxy</tt> method of <tt>NSConnection</tt> you click on the link to <tt>NSDistantObject</tt>, and from there to the Distributed Objects manual, where you find a heading, &quot;<a href=\"http://gemma.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/DistrObjects/Tasks/substitutions.html\">Making Substitutions During Message Encoding</a>&quot;, which tells all.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of your journey you find good old <tt>NSPortCoder</tt> and see that it has two methods, <tt>isByCopy</tt> and <tt>isByRef</tt> which report whether the coder will encode by copying (the behaviour you&apos;re trying to avoid) or by reference (but is this the desired behavior?; I suspect that what actually gets passed is an <tt>NSDistantObject</tt> proxy and not the real <tt>NSInvocation</tt>). But you&apos;ve now got your working (but ugly) <tt>NSNumber</tt> workaround, so the question becomes, how much work will it take to force your <tt>NSConnection</tt> to pass the invocation as an unmodified pointer instead of by copying, and will it be worth it? Will you have to subclass <tt>NSConnection</tt>? Or <tt>NSInvocation</tt>? Or <tt>NSPortCoder</tt>? Might you even have to subclass <tt>NSDistantObject</tt>?</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;m going to explore these questions and see what I find out.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000249more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

Today I addressed the one remaining issue in my build chain (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/03/dstroot_install.php\">previously mentioned here</a>): an automated process to produce release builds with debugging symbols stripped while keeping an unstripped copy locally for the purposes of deciphering crash reports.</p>\n\n<p>So, as far as can tell, my many weeks of work beating my Xcode tool chain into shape are at an end. A full clean and build of <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> (measured using <tt>time xcodebuild clean build -target &quot;Synergy Advance.app&quot; -configuration Release</tt>) takes about six and a half minutes. The total number of lines of code is in the vicinity of 120,000 lines (for the application itself, supporting frameworks, plug-ins and unit tests).</p>\n\n<p>The best case scenario for subsequent builds, performing another build immediately after without changing any source files, takes about one and a half minutes (measured with <tt>time xcodebuild build -target &quot;Synergy Advance.app&quot; -configuration Release</tt>). Admittedly it would be nice if this time were a little lower but there are some parts of the build process (certain shell script phases) that have to be done on every single build even if no source files change; this because there is no non-kludgey way to determine when these things should be done, so you have to do them every time. Nevertheless, I am pretty happy with the process now; it&apos;s certainly much speedier than it was in the past when even the best case scenario seemed to drag on for ever.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000252more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

I just made that mistake, out of curiosity, and it hard froze my system. By &quot;hard freeze&quot; I mean that not even the mouse pointer would move, the clock stopped updating, the machine did not respond to pings from elsewhere on the local network, and the only thing that seemed to be working well were the fans (roaring like hair dryers).</p>\n\n<p>Half an hour later, I&apos;m back up, after rebooting from the Mac OS X install DVD and running Disk First Aid just to be safe, and hoping that none of the open files I was working on at the time were corrupted. This is the 38th &quot;involuntary reboot&quot; I&apos;ve had since purchasing this machine (9 kernel panics and 29 hard resets). The mean time between such failures has been about 10 days.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, I only double-clicked on <tt>Reggie SE</tt> because Spotlight had just let me down, beachballing eternally when I typed &quot;Spin con&quot; in an effort to find the <tt>Spin Control</tt> application to assist me with my debugging efforts.

He has this to say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>I&apos;m aware many people who have the site in their feeds will be trying to access it via something based on WebKit/WebCore. Safari may have crashed, and you lost all your open tabs. You may have had your RSS reader up, and opened up some links in tabs, and down it all went. Read whatever you will into the fact that while these things did occur to me, I&apos;m attaching it inline instead of linking to it separately anyways.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mister &quot;Batman&quot;, you are now officially on my shit list. In some countries it&apos;s illegal to knowingly exploit that kind of vulnerability (akin to writing a virus or trojan). You could be opening yourself to civil prosecution as well for wilful and malicious destruction of other people&apos;s data. In all countries it&apos;s just plain bad form, and even worse when you <em>know</em> that your readership is almost exclusively Mac users, a large portion of them running Safari. I&apos;m removing you from my list of &quot;weekly rounds&quot;, I&apos;ll never be visiting your site again, and I&apos;ll be advising anyone that asks me to avoid your website and all its self-important, opinionated ramblings like the plague.</p>\n\n<h4>Update (20 April 2006)</h4>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/04/update_to_the_d.php\">just posted an article</a> with new information that has come to light. The short version: &quot;drunkenb@gmail.com&quot; sent me a pair of email messages attempting to crash my mail client; given the timing of the attacks I presumed that they came from &quot;Drunken Batman&quot;; a pair of individuals pointed out to me that &quot;Mr Batman&quot; does not usually use a Gmail email address; later &quot;Mr Batman&quot; posted an article denying that he was responsible for the messages and insulting me in such a way that pretty much confirms my opinion of him. For <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/04/update_to_the_d.php\">full details see my update article</a>; to see the original content of this article (posted immediately after receiving the attacks), read on.</p>\n\n<h4>Previous updates</h4>\n\n<p>I&apos;m rather speechless, but &quot;drunkenbatman&quot; (or someone purporting to be him) must be having a bad day because he just sent me an unsolicited email containing an image in an effort to crash my Mail application. This is one step beyond posting the crash-provoking image on his website for unsuspecting members of the public to stumble across and &quot;be taught a lesson&quot;; this time it&apos;s a personalized attack directed specifically at me, and so it brings all manner of nasty adjectives to mind to describe the personality of this guy. I guess it means he gets a promotion from &quot;thoughtless dickhead who crashed a random bunch of people&apos;s computers&quot; to &quot;arrogant asshole who misguidedly thinks he has a right to do harm to specific individuals in order to &apos;make a point&apos;&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Mr &quot;Batman&quot; failed to crash my Mail application because I stripped the attachment before viewing the message using Mail&apos;s handy &quot;Eliminar archivos adjuntos&quot; item in the &quot;Message&quot; menu (not sure how it&apos;s worded in the English localization; I&apos;m running in Spanish). This is the first contact I&apos;ve had with this charming gentleman who right now is behaving like a petulant script-kiddie: note that although his email is titled &quot;My reply&quot; I&apos;ve never contacted him in the past; he&apos;s responding to this weblog post.</p>\n\n<p>He writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>I think you&apos;ll find my argument quite compelling.<br>\n<br>\nthx,<br>\n<br>\nDB</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I don&apos;t see any &quot;argument&quot; at all. All I see is an asshole who just tried, unsuccessfully, to remotely crash a program running on my computer. I think there are much better ways of making a point. Once again, I counsel anyone reading this to steer well clear of this guy&apos;s website. Is this really the sort of person whose writing you want to read?</p>\n\n<p>[Later on...]</p>\n\n<p>Drunken &quot;Hacker&quot; Batman has just made <em>another</em> attempt at crashing my mail application, this time trying to conceal his attack using the name &quot;Customer Support&quot; and the subject, &quot;Enrol to beta test the new version of Adobe DreamWeaver today!&quot;. This guy has all the cleverness of an idiot spammer and just as much charm. I must admit to being surprised at the levels of pigheaded arrogance that this fellow is capable of attaining. How low will this guy sink? What is his point exactly? That Apple has a vulnerability in one of their frameworks? (<em>Gasp!</em>) That it can be remotely triggered? (<em>Wow!</em>) That not only can it be remotely triggered, but that he, <em>the one and only Drunken Batman</em>, is so clever and hardcore that he&apos;s prepared to break the law and risk litigation in order to show it? (<em>Awesome!</em>) I guess that his motivation must be in their somewhere, but the only thing he&apos;s achieved so far is to demonstrate what an asshole he is (oh, and to waste my time... please, Mr Batman, fuck off and stop bugging me; I&apos;ve got much better things to do than tell the world what a dick you are).</p>\n\n<p>Thank god for filters. Set your mail client to route all messages from <strong>drunkenb@gmail.com</strong> to the trash and you&apos;ll be fine; better yet block it at the sendmail level. Of course, that might not protect you in the event that he decides to use another address (and he does seem to be the sort of puerile jackass who&apos;d be inclined to try), but it&apos;s a step at least.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing as it hasn&apos;t yet gotten through Mr &quot;Batman&apos;s&quot; thickened skull, I&apos;ll share with him what I believe are the appropriate means of disclosing a vulnerability. Here are some simple steps in &quot;do&apos;s and don&apos;ts&quot; format:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><em>Do</em> report the vulnerability to the vendor.</li>\n<li><em>Do</em> make a public announcement at an appropriate time if and only if you feel it&apos;s in the public interest.</li>\n<li><em>Do</em> provide a reproducible test case, but only to those who are interested: don&apos;t ram it down people&apos;s throats by trying to remotely exploit vulnerabilities on their computers without warning.</li>\n<li><em>Don&apos;t</em> send emails to specific individuals that disapprove of your conduct (see point 3) in an attempt to cause crashes; for the braindead (that&apos;s you, Mr &quot;Batman): this is just as nasty as writing a virus, worm or a trojan.</li>\n<li>If you fail in your first attempt to cause a crash on your target&apos;s computer, <em>don&apos;t</em> come trying again using low-level spammer tricks; you shouldn&apos;t be doing it in the first place.</li>\n<li>If you&apos;re upset with your vendor, <em>do</em> feel free to complain about it or write a rational criticism; but being upset is no excuse to start acting like an asshole.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<div id=\"a000266more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>The first message in full:</p>\n\n<pre>Return-Path: &lt;drunkenb@gmail.com&gt;\nReceived: from nproxy.gmail.com (nproxy.gmail.com [64.233.182.189])\n\tby s69819.wincent.com (8.12.11.20060308/8.12.11) with ESMTP id k2VImHYR012480\n\tfor &lt;win@wincent.com&gt;;

    "file": "content/blog/smarter-crash-reports-i-give-up",
    "html": "<p>A long time ago, before Unsanity released &quot;Smart Crash Reports&quot;, I tried to come up with my own version of Apple&apos;s crash reporter application.  I did this because the existing third-party solutions that I saw looked like horrible kludges. They&apos;d do things like watch for the launch of the Apple crash reporter (polling), kill it so that the window wouldn&apos;t bother the user, throw up their own window, wait for the crash report to be written to the disk (again polling), and finally let the user send the crash report.</p>\n\n<p>When Unsanity released &quot;Smart Crash Reports&quot; I wasn&apos;t impressed either. I didn&apos;t want users to have to install additional software and I certainly didn&apos;t agree with the idea of <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2006/01/smart_crash_reports\">installing a hack (an input manager) without notifying the user</a>. There are some who think that <a href=\"http://www.drunkenblog.com/drunkenblog-archives/000654.html\">Unsanity can do no wrong</a> but I simply don&apos;t like hacks (and yes, Input Managers are hacks).</p>\n\n<p>My plan was to implement everything from scratch: catch the crash (uncaught signals, uncaught exceptions), generate stack traces and gather other information, and send it off to the user. The first version of my crash catcher was released with <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/\">WinSwitch</a> back in December 2004 (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winswitch/history/\">version 3.0b</a>). The problem with my crash reports is that they weren&apos;t as detailed as Apple&apos;s, because it&apos;s fiendishly difficult to generate stack traces reliably across versions of the OS, different architectures, and from within signal handlers.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000267more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>Yet getting reliable stack traces is in theory possible; Apple&apos;s crash reporter does it, <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/\">GDB</a> does it, third party crash catchers like the one that comes with <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/\">Mozilla</a> (&quot;Talkback&quot;) presumably do it. I searched around for libraries, sample code and other resources that might help me to do this in a non-kludgey way. The GDB code base is too large for me to even know where to begin looking, and in any case the license I am working with is incompatible with the GPL. The same problem applies to the Mozilla &quot;Talkback&quot; code. I don&apos;t know whether any of the Darwin source code might shed light on the issue, but it too would present me with licensing difficulties.</p>\n\n<p>I looked at the ExceptionHandling framework (see <tt>/System/Library/Frameworks/ExceptionHandling.framework/Headers</tt>) which does provide some <a href=\"http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?StackTraces\">undocumented (private) functionality</a> for obtaining stack traces but I don&apos;t like to rely on undocumented APIs, especially when they provide stack traces far inferior to those shown in Apple&apos;s crash reporter (for example, they don&apos;t work well properly from with signal handlers and the safety of calling these methods from within a signal handler is unknown).</p>\n\n<p>I did a little bit of tentative reverse engineering of Apple&apos;s code too, trying to get some clues as to what was happening behind the scenes and what libraries might be involved, but my probing with <tt>nm</tt>, <tt>otool</tt> and friends didn&apos;t really shed any light on the situation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://lists.apple.com/archives/darwin-dev/2005/May/msg00305.html\">This post</a> to the darwin-dev mailing list shows one way of using <a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/\">GCC&apos;s</a> <tt>__builtin_frame_address()</tt> and <a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Return-Address.html\">other built-in functions</a> to get a stack trace. One of my attempts at a solution did indeed use <tt>__builtin_frame_address()</tt> but that didn&apos;t work well inside signal handlers either.</p>\n\n<p>The oft-referenced <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2004/tn2123.html\">CrashReporter Technical Note TN2123</a> says this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>There is currently no way for third party developers to access the reports submitted via CrashReporter. Apple is aware that there is strong demand for such a facility (r. 3356232). In fact, various third party developers have implemented their own crash reporting mechanisms: these range from the simple (have the application look at its own crash log file at launch time; if it has changed, offer to submit it to the developer) to the exceeding complex (completely reimplement CrashReporter).</blockquote>\n\n<p>So I foolishly took the &quot;exceeding [sic] complex&quot; path. When the Intel machines came out I had to admit that I was out of my depth. Reliably producing stack traces for ppc, i386 <em>and</em> ppc64 architectures on multiple versions of the OS just seemed over my head. The best sample code I could find was the <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/MoreIsBetter/MoreIsBetter.html\">MoreIsBetter</a> sample code from Apple. But this predates both Tiger and Panther and obviously is for ppc only: </p>\n\n<pre>  In the current Mac OS X architecture, there is no guaranteed reliable \n  way to backtrace a signal stack frame.  The problem is that the kernel \n  pushes a variable amount of data on to the stack when it invokes the \n  user space signal trampoline (_sigtramp), and the only handle to the \n  information about how much data was pushed is passed in a register \n  parameter to _sigtramp.  _sigtramp stashes that value away in a \n  non-volatile register.  So, when _sigtramp calls the user-supplied \n  signal handler, there&apos;s no way to work out where that register \n  ends up being saved.\n  \n  Thus, we devolve into guesswork.  It turns out that the offset from \n  the stack of the kernel data to the information we need (the place \n  where the interrupted thread&apos;s SP was stored) is a constant for any \n  given system release.  So, we can just simply add the appropriate \n  offset to the frame pointer and grab the data we need.\n  \n  The problem is that this constant varies from release to release. \n  This code handles the two significant cases that I know about, \n  namely Mac OS X 10.1.x and Mac OS X 10.2.x.  There&apos;s no guarantee \n  that this offset won&apos;t change again in the future.</pre>\n\n<p>It then later goes on to state:</p>\n\n<pre>  The only remotely reliable way to detect a signal stack frame is to \n  look at the return address to see whether it points within the \n  _sigtramp routine.  I can find the address of this routine via \n  the dynamic linker, but I don&apos;t have an easy way to determine it&apos;s \n  length.  So I just guess!  And here&apos;s the number I chose.  See \n  MoreBTPPCFindSigTrampAddress for more details on this.</pre>\n\n<p>So as you can see, the business of writing stack trace generation code is a nasty one (and we haven&apos;t even touched on address-to-symbol conversion yet nor C++ mangling). I tried, but I admit defeat. Given the choice between writing a mass of hideously complex and fragile code, installing a hack, or implementing something mildly kludgey, I&apos;ll choose the latter. The least kludgey way I can think of doing this is to check at launch the modification date on the crash reporter log file, and if it looks like the program did not cleanly exit fire up the crash reporter application. I say &quot;least kludgey&quot; because at least it doesn&apos;t require me to do any polling; but it does still require me to read in a chunk of a log file and send it off.</p>\n\n<p>My original &quot;ground-up&quot; implementation installed signal and uncaught exception handlers and forked a new child process if the program crashed. The act of forking prevented the Apple crash reporter window from showing up (good) but it also prevented the crash reports from being written to the log! This meant that all my elegant, non-kludgey code (for example, using kernel queues to watch for updates to the log without polling) didn&apos;t work.</p>\n\n<p>I am not aware of any way to elegantly catch crashes, suppress the Apple crash reporter window <em>and</em> extract the Apple-generated crash log. So I was forced to adopt the &quot;check-on-launch&quot; method. The downside is that I had to remove my nice &quot;Relaunch&quot; button from my crash reporter; users will have to relaunch manually.</p>\n\n<p>Another interesting quirk is that in my testing if you try to simulate a crash (for example, by doing a <tt>kill -SEGV</tt> from the command line) then no crash report is written. Seems like you need a real crash for Apple&apos;s crash reporter to kick in. In any case, all of this will be available to the public in the next release of <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a>. Let the crash reports roll in!</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>When I first started <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> one of my early goals was to implement the ability for the user to show and hide the Dock icon at will. I also envisaged the ability to show the cover art of the currently playing track in the Dock. This was fairly simple, so I just stuck the code for it in the application&apos;s main controller class.</p>\n\n<p>But since then things have gotten more complicated. After the icon was designed, and it turned out to be a speaker, the obvious idea was to animate that speaker during playback (credit goes to <a href=\"http://elroyonline.net/\">Elroy</a>, the designer of the icon, for that idea). Then I decided to add a progress meter. Then, seeing as the animated icon looked so cool, it seemed only natural to offer to show the cover art in the Dock as a badge rather than as a full icon. All of this is optional so the user can turn any of these features on or off in different combinations with the other options.</p>\n\n<p>Basically this adds up to a lot of image compositing and can be taxing on the CPU. Along the way I&apos;ve made some optimizations. A couple of days ago I decided to do a little bit more optimization, and at that point decided to split all of the Dock icon code off into a separate class, <tt>WODockIcon</tt>. That&apos;s what I&apos;ve been working on today. Instead of the main controller class having to worry about managing animation timers, progress bar timers, caches, compositing and so forth, it can just tell the <tt>WODockIcon</tt> class to do it all with simple messages like <tt>startAnimation</tt>, <tt>stopAnimation</tt> and <tt>setBadge:</tt>. The complexity is all neatly encapsulated away in the <tt>WODockIcon</tt> class, making the main controller less complex and easier to maintain.</p>\n\n<p>I also split some Dock-visibility related code off into an <tt>NSApplication</tt> category in a framework, once again to keep the main controller more simple and to make the Dock-manipulation code available to anything which links against the framework (preference panes, plug-ins and the like, as well as the main application).</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000291more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Free open source software is very popular. You may be wondering if giving away open source software for free (but accepting donations) is a workable business model for small vendors like <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/\">Wincent</a>.

Not factored in here are the costs in terms of programmer-hours required to write the software, nor the additional bandwidth consumed by visits to the WinSwitch website or downloads of the source code (the bandwidth figure is only for downloads of the WinSwitch disk image itself).</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s hard to look at these numbers and think of any way in which the &quot;open source + donations&quot; model can work for the small vendor. My advice to anyone considering it is to only do it if you want to contribute something to the community in a one-way, non-reciprocal fashion; as a business model it is unworkable and at best can be considered as a means of promoting your brand.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000292more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "file": "content/blog/a-farewell-to-self-checksumming",
    "html": "<p>When the first public preview of <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> came out in May 2005 it was the first <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/\">Wincent product</a> to incorporate a self-checksumming feature. Call it &quot;anti-corruption&quot; if you will, or call it &quot;anti-piracy&quot;; the basic premise is that the executable uses a checksum to guard against corruption, modifications or tampering.</p>\n\n<p>It was something I&apos;d started working on in late 2003 in response to the large number of <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">Synergy</a> cracks floating around. It&apos;s no secret that there is no such thing as uncrackable software, but it&apos;s also true that some protection is better than none. And in this age of trojans, spyware, and viruses, I felt that anything I could to reduce the likelihood of patched and cracked versions floating around in unofficial channels would be a good investment. I figured that a little effort spent increasing the complexity of an attack would be worthwhile. It turned out to be a very complex task and I must admit to being privately relieved when it was finally released to the public and it worked on multiple versions of the OS.</p>\n\n<p>Now such a checksum isn&apos;t really useful if it is trivial for an attacker to replace it. For example, if one were to place the checksum in the application&apos;s <tt>Info.plist</tt> file then an attacker could patch the binary, calculate a new checksum and easily stick it in the <tt>Info.plist</tt> file. You make the task of calculating a checksum more difficult by incorporating the checksum into the executable itself. But there&apos;s a feedback loop: in doing so you to modify the executable, thus changing its checksum and rendering the embedded checksum invalid.</p>\n\n<p>The workaround for this Catch-22 situation is to embed a known placeholder (for example, all zeros) in your executable which will be used to hold the checksum. You then overwrite the placeholder with the calculated checksum. In order to verify the checksum at runtime you operate on an in-memory copy of the executable in which the stored checksum has been extracted and then zeroed out, thus reverting the executable to its initial state. This is still not unbreakable security, but it is considerably more secure than the <tt>Info.plist</tt> solution; to break it the attacker needs to reverse engineer the checksum embedding process and then make a patch that not only patches the executable to change the way it works but also applies a correct, newly-calculated checksum as well. The other alternative is to make a patch which removes the checksumming procedures entirely, but this is evidently more difficult than it would be to produce a patch in the absence of such procedures.</p>\n\n<p>For added security Synergy Advance implemented a two-phase checksum check. Firstly, the framework containing the checksumming code was protected via a checksum. Secondly, the application itself was protected by a checksum. This meant that any effective attack would have to worry about neutralizing both measures. Like any good security scheme, there was scope for evolving the protection in response to successful attacks. If an effective patch was released into the wild then a subsequent version of the software could replicate the checksumming code to the application or to other frameworks, requiring increasingly complex patches. It all worked quite nicely.</p>\n\n<p>But the fun doesn&apos;t end there. There are two more problems to be overcome. Firstly, you need to be able to handle Universal Binaries, and that means your placeholder/checksum will appear twice in the executable, once for each architecture. Secondly, you need to cope with the dastardly abomination that is prebinding.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/Prebinding.html\">Prebinding</a> is the worst thing that happened to code-signing in the history of personal computers. The operating system &quot;prebinds&quot; an executable so as to make it launch faster, but in doing so <em>it actually modifies the data of the executable</em>! This means that if you generate a checksum for an executable, prebind it, then re-generate the checksum you very likely will find two different checksums. You can generate a checksum on one machine, copy the executable to another (perhaps running a different version of Mac OS X), and after prebinding you can only hope that the checksums are the same.</p>\n\n<p>The solution, then, for the purposes of checksum generation or executable signing, is to remove <em>all</em> prebinding information from the executable before generating the checksum. When you later want to verify the checksum you repeat the same process, stripping the prebinding information and then calculating the checksum.</p>\n\n<p>I came up with a tool, &quot;pbt&quot; (prebinding tool) to do this stripping. It was a small tool that could be easily bundled inside my application and which didn&apos;t rely on any external libraries of tools being present on the users&apos; systems. It worked very well for a while but somewhere along the way something broke. What&apos;s changed since then? There have been several updates to Mac OS X (from 10.4 through to 10.4.5), the first Intel-based machines have been released, and the Xcode Tools have received a few updates. I can&apos;t be sure but I think it was one of the Xcode updates that broke things.</p>\n\n<p>The problem was that &quot;pbt&quot; didn&apos;t work properly in some cases anymore. It would work on the framework but not on the application, inexplicably crashing when I tried to feed the binary to it. I never investigated too deeply why this was occurring, I just started looking for another solution. Apple&apos;s <tt>redo_prebinding</tt> tool, however, <em>did</em> work on both, so I switched to using that. Nothing&apos;s ever easy though, so to guarantee consistent results I had to manipulate the environment variables before running the tool. And to make matters worse, I later discovered that <tt>redo_prebinding</tt> is not part of the standard install on all versions of Mac OS X, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=387\">breaking checksum entirely</a> for users who didn&apos;t have it installed (at least on my 10.4.6 PowerPC system it is listed as belonging to the Developer Tools package).</p>\n\n<p>So that put an end to my self-checksumming efforts. Too many variables. Too many unknowns. Worse still, problems like the failure to launch due to a missing <tt>redo_prebinding</tt> tool (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=387\">bug #387</a>) and the abort due to a checksum mismatch (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=389\">bug #389</a>) were perceived by users as <em>crashes</em>. Doh! So I removed the checksumming and put out a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/history/#0.4b3\">new release</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I admit that I&apos;d prefer it if Apple hadn&apos;t gone down the prebinding path. Or, if they insisted, that they implement it in such a way that it did not alter an executable&apos;s binary data, thus rendering things like checksumming and code signing awkward at best and downright impossible at worst. Perhaps they could have stored the prebinding information elsewhere, in a central registry. Ironically, in Tiger Apple says prebinding is no longer necessary for better performance. In Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5) I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if all traces of it are swept from the system entirely.</p>\n\n<p>I didn&apos;t speak publicly about this stuff before because I was employing a dose of security-through-obscurity. But now that there&apos;s no self-checksumming in my products I guess there&apos;s no harm in writing about it. I&apos;ve gone down a different path now with respect to anti-tampering. I would&apos;ve preferred it if my checksumming could&apos;ve remained as one additional layer of protection, but it was not to be.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000296more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>So SSH dictionary attacks are becoming increasingly common. Yesterday my server was hit 2,901 times by a pair of nincompoops trying brute-force dictionary attacks. I think the odds of such an attack succeeding are fairly small:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>All 2,901 attacks were directed at non-existent accounts which, by definition, can never provide access to the server no matter how many passwords are tried.</li>\n<li>Most of the existing, standard accounts on the server (like <tt>apache</tt> and <tt>mysql</tt>) have their shell set to <tt>/bin/nologin</tt> and again can never provide access no matter how many passwords are tried.</li>\n<li>Attacking the root account is useless because remote root logins are disabled; again, no matter how many passwords are tried the attacker will never get access (beginning to see a pattern here?).</li>\n<li>The machine has a negligible number of other accounts, none of them with easy-to-guess names like &quot;wincent&quot; so it&apos;s highly unlikely that an attacker will stumble upon an actual valid account username.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://openssh.org/\">OpenSSH</a> provides no indication to the attacker what the reason for a failed login might be; the attacker doesn&apos;t know whether it&apos;s because the account is non-existent, logins are disallowed for that account, or the password is wrong, because in all cases the failure message is &quot;Permission denied, please try again.&quot;</li>\n<li>Even if the attacker does chance upon a valid account username he/she must still brute force the password; not easy to do given that I use lengthy, machine-generated passwords.</li>\n<li>If an attacker gets lucky and guesses a password for a valid account (about a 1 in 218,340,105,584,896 chance) then he will find himself in a chroot jail limited to the home-directory of the user in question; the worst he can do is delete some files in the home directory using an SFTP client, he <a href=\"http://www.pizzashack.org/rssh/\">doesn&apos;t even get shell access</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So the risks of a break-in are low but I decided to do something about it anyway for two reasons: firstly, I&apos;m sick of seeing these attacks listed in my daily LogWatch reports; and secondly, if enough clowns get together and try these attacks (for example with an army of compromised zombie PCs) then it could result in a denial-of-service attack on the server, making it harder for legitimate users to connect. A good auto-banner addresses both of these issues by using the firewall to immediately drop packets from attacking IPs.</p>\n\n<p>I evaluated some of the available solutions but in the end I whipped together my own. It&apos;s called Bansshee.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000297more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>DenyHosts</h4>\n\n<p>Written in Python, <a href=\"http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/\">DenyHosts</a>, scans your log files for break-in attempts and blacklists attacking IP addresses by putting them in your <tt>/etc/hosts.deny</tt> file. I rejected this option because I don&apos;t like the way it works by manipulating a flat-file, and because it apparently requires a version of Python newer than the one I have on my server. When it comes to things like that I prefer not to upgrade; I&apos;d rather leave it in the hands of trusty old <a href=\"http://www.redhat.com/\">Red Hat</a> to push out security updates and fixes as required.</p>\n\n<h4>Fail2Ban</h4>\n\n<p>Also written in Python, <a href=\"http://fail2ban.sourceforge.net/\">Fail2Ban</a>, this one works like DenyHosts but instead blocks attackers by using iptables (the firewall). Once again, I had to reject this one because it claims to need a newer version of Python.</p>\n\n<h4>sshdfilter</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://freshmeat.net/projects/sshdfilter/\">sshdfilter</a> takes a different approach. Instead of reading your log files it actually serves as a wrapper for the sshd daemon itself, capturing its standard output directly and responding instantly. Much more elegant, much more efficient, but I felt it was too much of an unknown quantity and too risky to deploy for a critical service like SSH (ie. what if there&apos;s a bug in the wrapper that ends up locking you out?). Furthermore, it wasn&apos;t clear to me whether I&apos;d need to reinstall after every single update to the operating system.</p>\n\n<h4>sshwatch.pl</h4>\n\n<p>My favourite of all is this <a href=\"http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/D/DR/DRAGOS/sshwatch-0.01.pl\">short perl script</a> by Dragos Constantinescu. Bonus points because it is very short and therefore easy to audit. You can read it and comprehend what it does in a few seconds, assess its strengths and weaknesses and decide with confidence whether it&apos;s the kind of thing you want to install on your server. This is not the case with DenyHosts and Fail2Ban, which are both large, complex packages which happen to be written in a language I don&apos;t understand (Python).</p>\n\n<h4>Bansshee</h4>\n\n<p>I ended up writing my own, as I always do (do I suffer from &quot;Not Invented Here&quot; Syndrome?).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Perl, not Python:</strong> Not because I think one is better than the other but for the same reason that I write this weblog in English instead of Chinese.</li>\n<li><strong>Short:</strong> The first completed version is 214 lines long, easy to comprehend, easy to audit. I am sure a Perl veteran could re-write the script into five lines or less of obfuscated code but my goal is readability and simplicity.</li>\n<li><strong>Uses the <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/~mgrabnar/File-Tail-0.99.3/Tail.pm\">File::Tail</a> module from <a href=\"http://cpan.org/\">CPAN</a>:</strong> which means that it can &quot;tail&quot; the <tt>/var/log/secure</tt> logfile in a relatively efficient manner and automatically catch things like rotating logs.</li>\n<li><strong>Homegrown regular expressions:</strong> written by me based on my analysis of the logfiles on my Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES release 3 system, so I <em>know</em> that they&apos;re right for my system.</li>\n<li><strong>Safe:</strong> Blocked IPs are periodically unblocked, thus eliminating the possibility of a legitimate user getting blocked forever by mistake.</li>\n<li><strong>Very simple implementation:</strong> the main thread watches for attacks and blocks IPs; a background thread periodically removes the blocks.</li>\n<li><strong>Configurable:</strong> Configure the number of &quot;unknown account&quot; attacks allowed from a given IP address before blocking it (defaults to 5); the number of &quot;incorrect password&quot; attacks allowed from a single IP (defaults to 5); the minimum number of seconds an IP must wait before it gets removed from the blocklist (defaults to 1 hour); the number of seconds that must pass before prior illegal/incorrect attempts are forgotten (defaults to 1 hour); the number of seconds between flushes of the blocklist, removing old IPs (defaults to 5 minutes).</li>\n<li><strong>Conservative firewalling policy:</strong> Blacklisted IP addresses are only denied access via SSH; their access to the other services on the server is not restricted (for example, HTTP access), thus reducing the risk of &quot;collateral damage&quot; (ie. on shared network, script kiddie tries to brute force SSH, as a result everybody else on the network loses web accesses).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the process of doing this I&apos;ve learnt a lot about iptables (coming from a FreeBSD background I only knew about ipfw). I think the protection should be fairly effective. With the default parameters an attacker can sustain only 5 unknown-user and 5 actual-user-but-incorrect-password attempts per hour without getting blacklisted.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, so I&apos;m currently testing it. If it performs as I expect I&apos;ll publicly release it.</p>\n\n<h4>Update</h4>\n\n<p>Bansshee has been <a href=\"http://bansshee.org/\">publicly released</a>.</p>\n</div></div>",

The other 2% of the time... well, it&apos;s probably your fault as well.</blockquote>\n\n<p>I <em>am</em> using <tt>NSPort</tt> objects in my application, and the crashes <em>are</em> happening in <tt>__NS<em>Port</em>DelegateTickler</tt> so the odds are something like this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There&apos;s a 98% chance that this is <em>not</em> a bug in Apple&apos;s code, and a 2% chance that it&apos;s probably not a bug in Apple&apos;s code... right...</li>\n<li>Perhaps there&apos;s a bug in my code (specifically narrowed down to the very small number of lines of code in my program that use <tt>NSPort</tt>); seems unlikely given that the program can run for hours on end without crashing (ie. the code &quot;works&quot;; and it can do exactly what you ask it to do thousands of times without a problem) and I had examined those few lines of code <em>extensively</em>...</li>\n<li>Most likely of all, there&apos;s something about the way <tt>NSPort</tt> and friends work that I either misunderstand or that is inadequately documented.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In my experience I&apos;ve been bitten by Apple documentation flaws many, many more times that I&apos;ve been bitten by actual Apple bugs. So with this in mind I set out about trying to reproduce this problem in the debugger and track down the cause.</p>\n\n<p>Now there were a number of reasons why this one was fiendishly difficult to track down:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It was intermittent; the program could run for hours and hours on end without hitting the bug despite heavy use.</li>\n<li>It was occurring entirely in Apple code, so I could not backtrace it to parts of my own code causing the problem; in other words, if my code was causing the problem it was causing it indirectly or peripherally, with the cause of the problem separated from the actual site of the crash both in time (an unknown period) and space (across threads).</li>\n<li>The crashes were all occurring in <tt>__NSPortDelegateTickler</tt> but they looked different. Sometimes it was a <tt>KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS</tt>, at others a <tt>KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE</tt>; there were a few different possibilities for the final stack frames of the crash logs; the crash only seemed to happen on PowerPC processors, but a similar crash (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=397\">bug #397</a>) was happening on the Intel platform and it looked suspiciously related (specifically, the crash was occurring in <tt>CFRunLoopDoObservers</tt>, never getting as far as <tt>__NSPortDelegateTickler</tt>, but <tt>CFRunLoopDoObservers</tt> always appeared in the stack traces for the PowerPC crashes just before the call to <tt>__NSPortDelegateTickler</tt>).</li>\n<li>I have no idea what <tt>__NSPortDelegateTickler</tt> does; it is private, undocumented API. Do a Google search for it and you&apos;ll find absolutely <em>nothing</em> useful. What the hell is a <em>tickler</em> anyway?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The first (and only) good news that I received was that if I set a breakpoint on <tt>__NSPortDelegateTickler</tt> and got it to print a hit-count and auto-continue then the crash was highly reproducible. Instead of taking hours to crash it would most often crash within seconds. So I suspect there was something timing related. The extra time required to hit the breakpoint, log the hit-count and continue was enough to trigger whatever it was that was causing the crash.</p>\n\n<p>I started analyzing, looking for patterns. What user interface actions could be used to trigger the bug? What preference settings? Did the crashes have something to do with threads? With Apple Events? Did they have something to do with hot key events? Bit by bit I started to establish patterns, correlations, form suspicions about possible causes and effects, and rule out unrelated factors.</p>\n\n<p>Once I knew I could reproduce it, I knew I&apos;d be able to fix the bug, no matter how painful that fix might end up being. Best of all, once I started to narrow down my range of suspicions to a single source (specifically, my <tt>NSThread</tt> category) I was able to create a simple Xcode project containing a minimal test case, and <em>boom</em>, I was able to reproduce the crash in a project containing <em>only</em> the category under suspicion and a simple controller class that I used to fire a timer 10 times a second to invoke the offending method and provoke a crash.</p>\n\n<p>Yet still, after several days of hunting I was unable to get rid of the crashes. It seemed that the crashes were being caused by the Apple frameworks trying to manipulate dead mach ports. I was able to avoid the crashes, but at the cost of leaking mach ports. Leaking mach ports is bad because if your program runs for a long enough time you&apos;ll eventually use up so many ports that the system will slow to a crawl. In a worst case scenario the machine will become all but unusable until your application is quit or dies.</p>\n\n<p>So, eliminating the crashes at the cost of leaking mach ports was not an acceptable workaround and it still didn&apos;t help me to understand the real cause of the crashes. Why were the crashes occurring only sporadically? What was the real trigger?</p>\n\n<p>I registered for <tt>NSConnectionDidDieNotifications</tt> and <tt>NSPortDidBecomeInvalidNotifications</tt> and printed stack backtraces whenever they were received in an effort to find out where, when, and why connections and ports in my application were dying. I tried looking at Apple sample code (such as the <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/TrivialThreads/TrivialThreads.html\">Trival Threads</a> and <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/SimpleThreads/SimpleThreads.html\">Simple Threads</a> samples) to see why and where you should (or should not) call the <tt>invalidate</tt> methods.</p>\n\n<p>To cut a long story short, after several days of trying to hunt this down I formed the suspicion that my invalidation was occurring on the wrong threads. None of this is particularly well documented, but it seems that the following is true:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In a typical inter-thread communication case you&apos;ll have one <tt>NSConnection</tt> in the calling thread, and another in the secondary thread; you&apos;ll also have two <tt>NSPort</tt> objects that are actually shared by the connections.</li>\n<li>If you never call <tt>invalidate</tt> on either of the connections or either of the ports, you may still see invalidation notifications generated by the behaviour of the frameworks (for example, invalidating when an object is released upon the destruction of an autorelease pool.</li>\n<li>If you don&apos;t call <tt>invalidate</tt> on the ports then you&apos;ll leak mach ports (bad).</li>\n<li>If you <em>do</em> call <tt>invalidate</tt> on the ports then you might crash randomly and extremely intermittently.</li>\n<li>Calling <tt>invalidate</tt> on the connections has little effect on the crashes or on the mach port leakage (or non-leakage), and may be unnecessary anyway depending on the already-mentioned behaviour of the frameworks with respect to autorelease pools.</li>\n<li>The docs say very little about what calling <tt>invalidate</tt> on a port actually does; they merely say that it gets &quot;marked as invalid&quot;, but what does &quot;marked as invalid&quot; mean? It seems that marking ports (in reality, mach ports) as invalid involves adjusting their right counts and stops them from leaking.</li>\n<li>Order seems to matter: marking a connection as invalid doesn&apos;t necessarily invalidate its ports, but marking a connection&apos;s ports as invalid may invalidate the connection.</li>\n<li>That docs do say a little more about what marking an connection as invalid actually does; namely that it &quot;withdraws&quot; the ports that the connection has registered with the current run loop.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That last bit about the &quot;current run loop&quot; got me thinking, because the docs also say, elsewhere, that &quot;[t]he NSRunLoop class is generally not considered to be thread-safe and its methods should only be called within the context of the current thread. You should never try to call the methods of an NSRunLoop object running in a different thread, as doing so might cause unexpected results.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>This meant that invalidating a connection was a potentially dangerous operation, if done from the wrong thread. Now, my testing showed that invalidating the connection wasn&apos;t strictly necessary in order to avoid mach port leakage, but the documentation suggested that if the connection was being automatically registered with the current run loop at initialization then it would probably be a good idea to invalidate it later on to remove it from that run loop. And given the threading issues I should probably take care to ensure that that invalidation took place on the same thread in which the connection was first created.</p>\n\n<p>So I made changes to the code to <em>guarantee</em> that that would always happen rather than leaving it in the lap of the gods. But I was still left with the issue to decide what to do with my port objects. In the end, it seems that the following method both avoids crashes and doesn&apos;t suffer from any mach port leakage problems:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create your connection and ports in thread 1.</li>\n<li>Create corresponding connection in thread 2.</li>\n<li>Dispose of the connection in thread 2 (invalidate it) to ensure that the ports get removed from its run loop; in reality you don&apos;t have to do this explicitly because when the thread terminates its autorelease pool should free the connection which in turn will invalidate itself automatically.</li>\n<li>Dispose of the connection in thread 1 (invalidate it) to ensure that the ports get removed from its run loop (note that you can&apos;t actually control the order of these two steps due to the concurrent execution of the threads).</li>\n<li>Only after the disposal of the connection should you (must you) invalidate the ports, and it seems safest to do this on the thread that originally created them (not only because this was where they began but also because it&apos;s in that thread in which you can know once you&apos;re finally &quot;done with&quot; the connection; that is, once you&apos;ve receive your message(s) from the second thread. The other option is to let each thread dispose of its own receive port (or its own send port); for the time being I&apos;ve chosen the former.</li>\n<li>You must dipose of <em>both</em> ports (invalidating them, that is); or you&apos;ll leak ports.</li>\n<li>You&apos;ll need to take care of concurrency issues if you share the responsibility for invalidation across two threads.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Following these rules I&apos;ve found that the crashes have indeed gone away. Before making these changes I could precipitate a crash &#x2014; often within seconds but never more than a few minutes &#x2014; by setting a breakpoint on <tt>__NSPortDelegateTickler</tt>, thus forcing the timing issue and exposing the crash. After making these changes I can run Synergy Advance for extended periods, and even with the breakpoint set and clocking up literally thousands of hits I have yet to see a recurrence of the dreaded tickler crash.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>First, as background if you haven&apos;t read the original story, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/03/drukenbatman_ge.php\">here it is</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now for the update.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000302more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>&quot;Drunken Batman&quot; has now (well, on 6 April actually, but its only just come to my attention) publicly stated that one of two things is the case. Either:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Wincent Colaiuta is mental, and just making the emails up. People that delusional are pretty rare, so I consider this to be a very low probability.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Someone is pranking him, and he doesn&apos;t know enough about how these things work to realize what&apos;s going on or what to look for, and is jumping to hysterical conclusions all across the board. I consider this to be a very high probability.</blockquote>\n\n<p>He later goes on to say the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>After a quick search of his site for recent references to DrunkenBlog, my personal opinion is it didn&apos;t even occur to this guy they weren&apos;t from me, or that I&apos;d never even seen his post. He had some resentments to grind, they fit in, his ego massaged out all the big red blinking warning signs that are all right there, and off he went. I certainly don&apos;t expect a correction or retraction, as that&apos;s how these things go. In a way, it&apos;s always good to have a reminder that the weakest link when it comes to security is usually not the tools within the system, but a tool sitting in front of it.</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, to summarize:</p>\n\n<h4>He claims not to have sent the email messages attempting to crash my mail client</h4>\n\n<p>I accept him at his word. If he says he didn&apos;t send them, then I believe him.</p>\n\n<h4>He suggests that I might be a liar and/or &quot;delusional&quot;</h4>\n\n<p>I am neither a liar nor delusional. I disapproved of his posting of the crasher image, and when I received the attack emails I was surprised and updated my article accordingly with information about the emails. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything delusional about my article but I <em>do </em> think that Mr &quot;Batman&apos;s&quot; tone is offensive, condescending and insulting.</p>\n\n<h4>He accuses me of &quot;jumping to hysterical conclusions&quot;</h4>\n\n<p>Once again I have to disagree. I think my conclusions were logical enough: (1) &quot;Drunken Batman&quot; crosses the line by deliberately crashing hundreds (or even thousands) of people&apos;s browsers; (2) I post an article stating my disapproval; (3) I receive two emails purportedly from &quot;Drunken Batman&quot; attempting to crash my email client. I really don&apos;t think it&apos;s that unreasonable to conclude that the emails most likely came from him.</p>\n\n<h4>He accuses me of being ignorant or stupid in various ways: &quot;retarded kid&quot;, &quot;tool&quot;, &quot;sucker&quot;, &quot;weakest link&quot; and so forth</h4>\n\n<p>I think his insults are without foundation; those who know me know that this isn&apos;t the case, and those who don&apos;t know me need only look at the content of my website to tell whether I&apos;m &quot;stupid&quot; or not. He thinks I&apos;m a retarded kid; I think he&apos;s an opinionated, egotistical loud mouth.</p>\n\n<h4>He says that it didn&apos;t even occur to me that the emails might be from someone else</h4>\n\n<p>It&apos;s true that I initially didn&apos;t think about alternative explanations. I was incredulous, I couldn&apos;t believe he&apos;d sink so low; but neither did I think that any third party would be bored enough to monitor both his weblog and mine, register a Gmail account in his name, and then impersonate him just to amuse him or herself. Forced to choose between the two explanations, the least probable by a long shot was the &quot;impersonation&quot; one.</p>\n\n<p>After posting my article I did receive a couple of emails from people who have previously corresponded with &quot;Drunken Batman&quot; who pointed out to me that the address in the emails is not the one that &quot;Drunken Batman&quot; has used with them in the past. For example, here are some comments:</p>\n\n<pre>Are you sure it really Michael &quot;Drunkenbatman&quot; Bell who sent you\nthe email containing the WebKit-crash-inducing image?\n<br>\nI&apos;m not saying it to defend him. I certainly consider the way he\nposted the crash-inducer on his weblog to be a dick move.\n<br>\nI&apos;m just saying I&apos;m not convinced that message you got came from\nhim. The handful of times I&apos;ve exchanged email with him, he hasn&apos;t\nbeen using Gmail.\n<br>\nThe name is spelled &quot;Drunken Batman&quot;. I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ve ever seen\nhim put a space in there, I think Bell always spells it either\n&quot;Drunkenbatman&quot; or &quot;drunkenbatman&quot;.\n<br>\nIf it really was him who sent you the crasher via email, well\nthat&apos;s just astounding.\n<br>\nOrdinarily it would strike me as unlikely, but my gut feeling is\nthat Mr. Batman made several hundred enemies when posted that\ncrasher. I&apos;m imagining, for example, someone who had a\nhalf-written draft of a weblog post sitting in a text area field\nin another tab or window of Safari when they encountered his\ndeliberate crasher.\n<br>\nOne more thing: Drunkenbatman has stated several times that he&apos;s a\ndevout user of GyazMail; all my email from him has an X-Mailer\nheader saying:\n<br>\n    X-Mailer: GyazMail version 1.2.4\n<br>\nIf it *was* DB who sent you that email, perhaps the explanation is\nthat because GyazMail uses WebKit for HTML messages, he couldn&apos;t\nuse it to send that picture to you.\n<br>\nI&apos;m nowhere near as surprised as you are. Except for the email\nbomb.</pre>\n\n<h4>He says he doesn&apos;t expect a correction or a retraction</h4>\n\n<p>We&apos;ll he&apos;s wrong about that too. I am not the delusional retard that he implies. It&apos;s always only been my intention to post the facts and now that I have more facts I&apos;m posting them here. As I stated in reply to one of the people who emailed me:</p>\n\n<pre>Like you, if it really is him who&apos;s been doing it I&apos;m astounded. But  \nif I found out that it&apos;s not him I&apos;ll edit what I&apos;ve written  \naccordingly. I&apos;m not so much upset as utterly astounded that someone  \nso highly regarded would act like this guy is acting.</pre>\n\n<p>&quot;Mr Batman&quot; helpfully provides a PDF of my original article &quot;in case it goes away&quot;, but I don&apos;t have anything to hide; in light of this new information I&apos;ve made the following edits to my original article:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Changed &quot;<em>the guy whose ugly mug you can see pictured on the right</em>&quot; to &quot;<em>pictured on the right</em>&quot;; I only added that in after I received the attack emails, but given that they apparently were not from him I&apos;ll tone it down (no need to impugn his looks).</li>\n<li>Added a note and a link to back to this update.</li>\n<li>Inserted &quot;or someone purporting to be him&quot; in the description of the attack emails.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Changes that won&apos;t be made to the original article</h4>\n\n<p>The article is still about &quot;Drunken Batman&quot; getting on &quot;the shit list&quot;. His original act (knowingly posting the crashing image) still stands.</p>\n\n<p>The original article stated something like, &quot;<em>I&apos;ll be advising any that asks to avoid your website like the plague</em>&quot;. After receiving the attack emails I later upgraded this to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>I&apos;ll be advising anyone that asks me to avoid your website and all its self-important, opinionated ramblings like the plague.</blockquote>\n\n<p>After reading your response to me, filled with flaming insults, condescension and arrogance, I don&apos;t see any reason for toning down my language. My recommendation to avoid your site stands, stronger than ever.</p>\n\n<h3>Comments from third parties</h3>\n\n<p>One thing I will say for &quot;Mr Batman&quot;, he doesn&apos;t censor people&apos;s negative comments. Here&apos;s a sample; I&apos;ve inserted some comments of my own where appropriate in italics:</p>\n\n<blockquote>You&apos;re still a dick for embedding the image instead of using a link.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>You act like a dick, then you&apos;re surprised than people think you&apos;re a dick?\nYour name is now associated with malware, deal with it.</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>To be clear, posting a crasher image in a weblog article isn&apos;t the same as writing &quot;malware&quot;. Malware is software that runs on your computer with a destructive intent. What &quot;Mr Batman&quot; posted was an exploit for an existing vulnerability. It&apos;s not the same as malware even if the destructive intent is the same (and it is). So if we&apos;re disciplined with our use of terminology we can&apos;t really accuse &quot;Mr Batman&quot; of propagating &quot;malware&quot; but we <strong>can</strong> lump him in the same moral basket as those that do write and knowingly distribute malware.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>Looks like old Wince read to much unserfriendly lately and got an inspiration how to generate some traffic for his b-list blog. Just leave the blighter alone.</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>To be clear: I&apos;m not trying to generate traffic to my &quot;b-list blog&quot;. Look on my website (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/\">http://www.wincent.com/</a>) for links to the weblog; you&apos;ll find <strong>one</strong> buried in the never-visited backwaters of the site. I&apos;m a software developer, not a &quot;weblogger&quot;. My personal weblog is where I post articles about stuff that I&apos;m working on for people that want a behind-the-scenes look at my software development. I also post the occasional rant that I think may be of interest to the one or two friends that I know read the weblog. I don&apos;t promote the weblog in any way. I don&apos;t try to drive traffic to it. When I posted the original &quot;Batman on the shitlist&quot; article I didn&apos;t make any attempt to contact the &quot;Batman&quot; himself; I merely posted it because I felt his conduct deserved comment. If one wants traffic I really think there are better ways to go about getting it; I see about 1,000 referrals from &quot;Mr Batman&quot; in my server logs: big deal.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>I don&apos;t really care that you don&apos;t like my weblog or consider it &quot;b-list&quot;; what I don&apos;t like is that you mistakenly think that I aspire for it to be anything else but that. My website gets a modest quarter of a million page views per month; of that figure the weblog accounts for a measly 5,000 page views. It&apos;s just not something that is in any way important to me. My weblogging days are in the past; I was a &quot;weblogger&quot; years before &quot;Mr Batman&quot; started his website, before the term &quot;weblog&quot; had even been coined. I had my &quot;five minutes of fame&quot; when Mac OS X came out, attracting about 50,000 page views per day. I even got &quot;real work&quot; out of it, receiving payment for writing articles for a number of sites. I was even invited to write books. But years ago I decided that I was much more interested in software development and that&apos;s my principal activity.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>He is a dick because of the way he choose to report it.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Thanks DB, for pointing out a stupid bug to the teeming masses, and possibly actually getting something done. :)</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>That&apos;s not how bugs should be &quot;pointed out&quot;.

All of this occurs within the same 24 hour period.

Remember that I have never had any contact with &quot;Mr Batman&quot; and so I had no way of knowing if he was a Gmail user or not. I find it indicative of the unpleasantness of &quot;Mr Batman&apos;s&quot; personality that he would use my quite reasonable assessment of the probabilities as an excuse to label me as an ignorant &quot;tool&quot; who knows nothing about security.

As such as I wasn&apos;t actually angry at &quot;Mr Batman&quot; (although many people got that impression from my post); but I <strong>did</strong> strongly disapprove of his decision. My low opinion of him has only been confirmed by his stubborn insistence on maintaining the offending image on the front page of his site, where it continues to this day (along with <strong>another</strong> article which will crash anyone unfortunate enough to visit that site in Safari).</em></p>\n\n<p><em>He&apos;s not only an asshole for doing this, but a fool as well as it&apos;s both harming his reputation and reducing his readership.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>Wincent Colaitua posted some of the first truly useful information about Mac OS X when it was released five years ago. I don&apos;t know if he&apos;s a hothead or not but I can safely say that his blog is not a b-list blog and his contributions to the general understand of Mac OS X is as important as John Welch&apos;s, John Gruber&apos;s, or even Mark Liyanage&apos;s. So, DB being a newcomer in comparison to Wincent might not know him, but Wincent does deserve props for his seminal web site for those of us who were just getting our feet wet with Mac OS X.</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Nice to know that people still remember my rumor-mongering days. The truth is though I am much happier now working as a software developer rather than a rumor-monger. Any Tom, Dick or Harry can post rumors; I don&apos;t have a lot of respect for people that do it, and even less for people who try to make a living off it. I have much more respect for people which are truly creative, produce software, or write educational, useful articles. I used to include &quot;Mr Batman&quot; in this latter category, but not any more.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>Wincent Colaitua may know a lot about OS X, but he knows shocking little about mail headers.</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Two things: Firstly, I didn&apos;t even bother to inspect the headers for evidence of forgery. Why would anyone bother to forge a Gmail email address? The accounts are free and can be obtained by anyone. Why forge email from &quot;someone@gmail.com&quot; when you can just go and register it yourself? When you receive an email from &quot;johnz23123@hotmail.com&quot; do you bother to inspect the headers to make sure it&apos;s <strong>really</strong> from John Z &quot;23123&quot;?</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Secondly, there is no evidence of forgery in the headers. Look at email sent from a Gmail address; the headers look exactly like that. It seems to be the poster of that comment who knows &quot;shocking little about mail headers&quot;.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>As to DB, well... I find your blog entertaining and all, but posting that last image inline? Yeah, a tad immature. Intentionally exploiting a bug is never ok.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>yes, DB was a bit of a dick, but the point was worth making.</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Agreed, he was &quot;a bit of a dick&quot;. I also believe that the vulnerability needed to be brought to Apple&apos;s attention.

You are no different than the much hated spammers that send me unsolicited mail.

Your assumptions are very likely right, someone other than you was pestering him. But I fail to see how your &quot;righteous&quot; indignation is somehow more righteous than his. After all your actions were the catalyst in this whole affair.</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Farewell for now</h3>\n\n<p>One of the things I find amusing about some of the comments that have been made in support of &quot;Mr Batman&quot; is that some of his defenders have attacked those who use tabs as not being sufficiently savvy. Use bookmarks, it&apos;s called browser history, duh, etc. How soon we forget the days when only Mozilla had tabs, tabs were the poster-child of every Linux-adoring nerd. Now, accordingly to &quot;Mr Batman&apos;s&quot; followers, if you rely on tabs or if you use them too much then you&apos;re some kind of neophyte. Er, right...</p>\n\n<p>Well I think I&apos;ve already wasted more than enough time on this subject. Time to get back to coding...</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>It&apos;s been a long time since I did a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/winhex/\">WinHex</a> release. One of the reasons has been that I&apos;ve had trouble compiling the <a href=\"http://swox.com/gmp/\">GMP arbitrary precision arithmetic library</a> upon which WinSwitch depends. Since the last release, GMP has been updated a couple of times, the version of <a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/\">GCC</a> that Apple ships with Mac OS X Xcode tools has seen updates too, and the first Intel-based machines are now available to the public.</p>\n\n<p>For a while newer versions of GCC were incapable of compiling GMP, but Apple&apos;s default compiler changed from GCC 2.95 to 3.3 and later to 4.0. Mixing applications and libraries built by different versions of GCC is not always a good idea. At some point (with the final 4.0 release, I believe) it became possible to compile GMP on a Mac again. GMP itself was updated to 4.1.4 and then to 4.2. As things currently stand, GMP will compile fine out of the box on a PowerPC platform running Mac OS X 10.4. It will only compile on Intel-based machines if you force it to use generic (but slower) C code rather than assembly.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000307more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>Building for Intel/Mac OS X 10.4</h4>\n\n<p>To build GMP on my Intel iMac I had to use the following commands:</p>\n\n<pre>./configure --build=none-apple-darwin8.6.1\nmake\nmake check</pre>\n\n<p>The key word is &quot;none&quot; which forces generic C code to be used rather than architecture-specific machine code. I got the &quot;darwin8.6.1&quot; value by first running <tt>./config.guess</tt>. I was then able to copy the sample code from the GMP <tt>INSTALL</tt> document into a file called <tt>example.c</tt> and test that it compiled:</p>\n\n<pre>gcc -g -I. example.c .libs/libgmp.a</pre>\n\n<p>And worked:</p>\n\n<pre># should print 31415926535897932384618573336104570964418\n./a.out 98365871231256752134 319378318340103345227</pre>\n\n<h4>Building for PowerPC/Mac OS X 10.3</h4>\n\n<p>If you build on a G5 machine you&apos;ll end up getting a 64-bit version of the library:</p>\n\n<pre>./configure\nmake\nmake check</pre>\n\n<p>If you want to build a library that will work on G4s (and even G3s) as well then you need to override the &quot;build&quot; setting:</p>\n\n<pre>./configure --build=powerpc-apple-darwin8.6.0\nmake\nmake check</pre>\n\n<p>Once again I used <tt>./config.guess</tt> to get the correct value for &quot;darwin8.6.0&quot;. You&apos;ll also note that I overrode the processor-specific &quot;powerpc970&quot; setting and pass just &quot;powerpc&quot; instead.</p>\n\n<p>This all worked fine, but when I actually tried to use the built library in my Xcode project I started to get strange linker errors like these, but only in the PowerPC part of my build:</p>\n\n<pre>/usr/bin/ld: Undefined symbols:\n_fprintf$LDBLStub</pre>\n\n<p>A quick search on Google turned up a few references to <tt>libSystemStubs</tt>. Specifically linking to the library did not help. And why should I have to link to it in my Cocoa app when my simple command-line test had worked just fine? So I did a quick search for that library on my system to see what was happening:</p>\n\n<pre>$ locate SystemStubs | xargs ls -laF\n-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel    640 Dec 25 08:35 /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.3.9.sdk/usr/lib/libSystemStubs.a\n-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel    640 Dec 25 08:35 /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.3.9.sdk/usr/lib/libSystemStubs_debug.a\n-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel    640 Dec 25 08:35 /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.3.9.sdk/usr/lib/libSystemStubs_profile.a\n-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel  76068 Dec 24 23:07 /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/lib/libSystemStubs.a\n-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel  76068 Dec 24 23:07 /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/lib/libSystemStubs_debug.a\n-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel  76180 Dec 24 23:07 /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/lib/libSystemStubs_profile.a\n-r--r--r--   1 root  wheel  76068 Dec 24 23:07 /usr/lib/libSystemStubs.a\n-r--r--r--   1 root  wheel  76068 Dec 24 23:07 /usr/lib/libSystemStubs_debug.a\n-r--r--r--   1 root  wheel  76180 Dec 24 23:07 /usr/lib/libSystemStubs_profile.a\n-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel  11056 Nov 10 18:55 /usr/local/share/darwinbuild/cache/Roots/8C46/SystemStubs.root.tar.gz</pre>\n\n<p>Now things started to become clear. Only the PowerPC builds were failing, but my Universal apps use the 10.4 SDK for the Intel part of the build and the 10.3 SDK for the PowerPC part. Notice that the SystemStubs library in the PowerPC SDK is much smaller? The symbols that the linker was looking for just weren&apos;t in that version of the library.</p>\n\n<h4>Cross-development SDKs for configure/make-based projects</h4>\n\n<p>So evidently, I hadn&apos;t really done the best job when I&apos;d compiled the PowerPC version of the library. Given that I had built it on a PowerPC running Mac OS X 10.4, it had used the installed copies of the libraries, equivalent to the ones in the 10.4 SDK. What I should have done was forced it to use the ones in the 10.3 SDK. When it came time to build my Cocoa app it was trying to use a library built for 10.4 but the rest of the PowerPC portion of the app was built for 10.3, yielding the linker error.</p>\n\n<p>A more experienced UNIX hacker would have realized this right from the start but it took a little while to sink in for me. Time to do some research. How do you force a configure/make-based project to use a different SDK?</p>\n\n<p>The official <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/cross_development/Using/chapter_3_section_2.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20002000-1114311-BABGCAAB\">Apple Cross-Development Programming Guide</a> says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>To select an SDK for a makefile, you add the appropriate options to your project&apos;s compile and link commands. For the compiler, you add the <tt>-isysroot</tt> option. For the linker, you add the <tt>-syslibroot</tt> option. If you are using GCC 4.0 to compile and link, you should add both commands to the command line.</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2137.html\">Tech Note 2137</a>, <em>Building Universal Binaries from &quot;configure&quot;-based Open Source Projects</em>, says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>The first approach is to simply have <tt>configure</tt> build a universal binary, by passing in the appropriate <tt>CFLAGS</tt> and <tt>LDFLAGS</tt> environment variables. This is done simply by running\n<br>\n<pre>env CFLAGS=&quot;-O -g -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch i386 -arch ppc&quot; \\\n  LDFLAGS=&quot;-Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk&quot; \\\n   ./configure --prefix=${HOME}/Hello --disable-dependency-tracking</pre>\nfrom the shell command prompt.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"http://lists.apple.com/archives/unix-porting/2005/Oct/msg00003.html\">this thread</a> on the Apple UNIX porting mailing list says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Sounds like we should change the technote to clarify that you should only set LDFLAGS to include -syslibroot if your makefile doesn&apos;t pass CFLAGS for linking. Your makefile apparently does use CFLAGS while linking.</blockquote>\n\n<p>And later in the thread:</p>\n\n<blockquote>All automake projects use CFLAGS for linking.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Armed with this information and some trial and error I found that I was able to build GMP using the 10.3.9 SDK with the following commands:</p>\n\n<pre>export SDK=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.3.9.sdk\nexport MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.3\nexport CFLAGS=&quot;-isysroot ${SDK}&quot;\n./configure --build=powerpc-apple-darwin8.6.0\nmake\nmake check</pre>\n\n<p>In my initial attempts I tried setting both <tt>CPPFLAGS</tt> and <tt>LDFLAGS</tt> as well but these always produced <tt>configure</tt> errors. By inspecting <tt>configure.log</tt> I eliminated the sources of the errors until I arrived at the final, working settings. Running <tt>nm</tt> on the built library showed that the source of the problem (the references to undefined symbols had been eliminated). WinHex is now building and linking again with the new version of the library, and running as a Universal Binary. Hopefully all this means that a new WinHex release will hit the servers in the not-too distant future.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Sadly I think I am alone in the world in not understanding Cocoa Bindings. Panther, and Cocoa Bindings, came out in October of 2003, well over two years ago. And <em>still</em> I find myself pulling my hair out whenever I try to do anything but the simplest binding of user interface elements in the preferences to the <tt>NSUserDefaults</tt> system.</p>\n\n<p>I look to the copious documentation for help but all I find are countless re-hashings of the same old Master-Detail interface, or the <tt>NSTableView</tt> managed using <tt>NSArrayController</tt>. It seems if you want to do anything else you&apos;re out of luck.</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s not that using Bindings is impossible. It&apos;s just that it&apos;s fiendishly, brain-fuckingly counter-intuitive. I can&apos;t figure out what to do from looking at the Interface Builder interface, from reading the docs, from looking at the sample code, or from reading the mailing list. More than any other Cocoa technology, Bindings is the one that has most stubbornly resisted integration into my (evidently) feeble brain. If you dare to ask a question on the mailing lists you can most likely expect to be pounced on by an irritable <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/mmalc/\">mmalc</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To make matters worse, the enlightened crowds can&apos;t stop cheering Apple for how wonderful their lives have become since Bindings came out, making my own misery only more painful. While they laugh and chat while sipping from pi&#xF1;a coladas in island resorts I spend hours and days futilely poring over documentation, fruitlessly clicking annoyingly tiny widgets in Interface Builder, and in general wasting a hell of a lot of time trying to achieve stuff that I could have done much more easily The Old Fashioned Way. This includes for even the most mind-numbingly simple stuff that has you smacking your head against the wall saying <em>this should be EASY, why the hell can&apos;t I do it?</em></p>\n\n<p>Everyone loves Cocoa Bindings. Me, I just don&apos;t get them.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000314more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

Today I sent a letter to my current provider asking them to close my account and I also lodged my application with the new provider.  So I am really not sure when the changeover will take place but I expect it will be within the next 30 days. I do not know how much downtime will be involved so please be aware that my email response time might not be as speedy as usual, as I will have to make trips outside the office with my laptop to get access. The automated systems (for things like <a href=\"https://secure.wincent.com/a/support/registration/\">lost license code retrieval</a>, <a href=\"https://secure.wincent.com/a/store/\">purchasing</a>, <a href=\"http://bugs.wincent.com/\">bug reporting</a> and so forth) will remain fully operational. Thanks for your patience and understanding.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 21 May 2006:</strong> I&apos;ve just been informed by the old ISP that my old connection will be active until 26 May 2006. I&apos;ve already signed the transfer authorization to the new ISP so hopefully there won&apos;t be too much delay (although it is possible seeing as both the ISP and the new one are third-party private companies that depend on the ex-government monopoly, <a href=\"http://telefonica.es/\">Telefonica</a>, to handle the disconnection and reconnection of the ADSL line).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 29 May 2006:</strong> My old ISP cut access off 5 days early and since then I&apos;ve been struggling with Telef&#xF3;nica to get temporary dial-up access to tide me over until the new ADSL connection goes live. Finally today I got that dial-up access after a whole week of trying, so I now have semi-regular access again and will be able to reply to emails much more promptly.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000316more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

Today was the last straw, when they finally informed me (weeks after receiving my letter of complaint) that they had no intention of refunding me any money. Great business model: charge a customer for something they don&apos;t want, ignore any requests to change to something they <em>do</em> want, and blame technical problems (&quot;the system&apos;s giving me an error&quot;) for your failure to do so. During this time ya.com has effectively been ripping me off for 30&#x20AC; per month, charging me 2004 prices for something that in 2006 is 6 times as fast and about one fifth the cost. That&apos;s 180&#x20AC; I&apos;m out of pocket, <em>plus</em> the time and money wasted calling them up, writing them letters each month, paying for printing, photocopying and certified postage, <em>plus</em> six months of inflated landline charges paid to the incumbent government-backed former monopolist, <a href=\"http://www.telefonica.es/\">Telef&#xF3;nica</a> (the plan I was trying to switch to included landline access).</p>\n\n<p>So bye bye, ya.com. I&apos;ve had enough. <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2006/05/email_response.php\">I&apos;m switching</a> and you&apos;ll never hear from me again. My new provider is <a href=\"http://www.jazztel.com/\">Jazztel</a>; no doubt their service is probably almost as bad as Ya.com&apos;s but at least their price is right.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000317more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>In my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/04/yacom_has_the_w.php\">last post on this subject</a> I quoted from the three letters of complaint I&apos;d sent ya.com so far and remarked on their gradually increasing irateness. In today&apos;s final letter (in which I inform them of my decision to cancel my account and again demand a partial refund) I didn&apos;t hold back at all.</p>\n\n<p>Here&apos;s a rough translation into English:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Who is responsible for the functioning of ya.com&apos;s systems if not ya.com itself? If the system doesn&apos;t work properly then it&apos;s up to ya.com to fix it. I don&apos;t know whether to suspect that ya.com is a bunch of incompetent, pathetic clowns, or a gang of barefaced, calculating con-artists.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, my 180&#x20AC; are probably gone forever but at least the issue has finally reached its culmination; ya.com won&apos;t be getting another cent out of me from this point on and I encourage anyone who might be in the market for an ADSL connection to steer well clear of them.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve just discovered that passing the <tt>-traditional</tt> switch to the preprocessor solves the problems discussed in the following post. The reason why I didn&apos;t discover this sooner is that the GCC man page has only this to say about the switch:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Formerly, these options caused GCC to attempt to emulate a pre-standard C compiler.  They are now only supported with the -E switch.  The preprocessor continues to support a pre-standard mode. See <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/gcc-4.0.1/cpp/Traditional-Mode.html\">the GNU CPP manual</a> for details.</blockquote>\n\n<p>No mention of trigraphs. No mention of comments. (Bad GNU!) But in short, it allows me to ignore <tt>//</tt> sequences in URLs without running into problems with trigraphs. You still have to change your included files to use only C-style comments but at least you don&apos;t have to wait for a future release of Xcode for Apple to improve their preprocessing. It&apos;s also a more robust solution because it doesn&apos;t require you to remember to replace instances of &quot;????&quot; in any newly-created property lists in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Continue reading to see my initial approaches to working around the problems...</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000323more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p><br>\nToday Xcode&apos;s <tt>Info.plist</tt> preprocessing feature started producing invalid XML for me, thus preventing any of my builds from completing. Source XML like this:</p>\n\n<pre>    &lt;key&gt;WOPlugInVendorWebsite&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;string&gt;http://www.wincent.com/&lt;/string&gt;\n&lt;/dict&gt;\n&lt;/plist&gt;</pre>\n\n<p>Was getting turned into this:</p>\n\n<pre>    &lt;key&gt;WOPlugInVendorWebsite&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;string&gt;http:\n&lt;/dict&gt;\n&lt;/plist&gt;</pre>\n\n<p>Evidently the preprocessor was seeing the <tt>//</tt> in the property list as a comment and was discarding it and everything following it (up to the end-of-line). I hadn&apos;t run into this problem before because up until today I had never had to put a URL into a preprocessed property list.</p>\n\n<p>Using the <tt>-C</tt> switch to GCC was not an option as that would prevent <em>all</em> comments from being discarded, and I only wanted the not-really-a-comment URL to be preserved. I did not fancy the idea of removing all comments from the header file that I include prior to preprocessing.</p>\n\n<p>The solution in the end was to pass the <tt>-ansi</tt> switch to the preprocessor. This causes <tt>//</tt> to not be treated as a comment marker. Traditional C-style comments (delineated with <tt>/*</tt> and <tt>*/</tt>) continue to be discarded. All I had to do then was convert the Objective-C style comments in my header to C-style comments, and add the following to my build configuration file:</p>\n\n<pre>INFOPLIST_OTHER_PREPROCESSOR_FLAGS = -ansi</pre>\n\n<p>But my problems did not end there. The <tt>-ansi</tt> has the effect of turning on GCC&apos;s trigraph support, that means that any property list containing the string &quot;????&quot; like this:</p>\n\n<pre>    &lt;key&gt;CFBundleSignature&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;string&gt;????&lt;/string&gt;</pre>\n\n<p>Will end up producing invalid XML like this:</p>\n\n<pre>    &lt;key&gt;CFBundleSignature&lt;/key&gt;\n    &lt;string&gt;??{/string&gt;</pre>\n\n<p>Specifically, the problem is that the sequence &quot;??&lt;&quot; is considered to be a trigraph sequence and is converted to &quot;{&quot; (see the GCC man page for more info on trigraphs).</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately there is no way of turning off trigraph support. GCC has a <tt>-trigraph</tt> switch but not a <tt>-no-trigraph</tt> switch. How to work around this? The <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPRuntimeConfig/Articles/ConfigApplications.html\">documentation</a> says that at a minimum all applications should include the <tt>CFBundleSignature</tt> key, and even though I&apos;m building frameworks and plug-ins (not applications), one can never be too careful when it comes to interpreting the documentation. Omitting the key entirely is therefore not an option even though &quot;????&quot; is the default. Neither is specifying an empty string as the consequences of such an action are not clear. Registering a new creator code for every single bundle is not a viable option either. Is there any way of escaping the trigraph so that the preprocessor won&apos;t convert it? If there is I don&apos;t know it.</p>\n\n<p>In the end I changed my property list to look like this:</p>\n\n<pre>  &lt;key&gt;CFBundleSignature&lt;/key&gt;\n  &lt;string&gt;WO_DEFAULT_SIGNATURE&lt;/string&gt;</pre>\n\n<p>And made yet another modification to my build configuration file:</p>\n\n<pre> INFOPLIST_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS = WO_DEFAULT_SIGNATURE=????</pre>\n\n<p>Xcode then produces something very close to what I&apos;m looking for:</p>\n\n<pre>  &lt;key&gt;CFBundleSignature&lt;/key&gt;\n  &lt;string&gt; ????&lt;/string&gt;</pre>\n\n<p>Notice the extra space inserted by the preprocessor? If you redefine <tt>WO_DEFAULT_SIGNATURE</tt> as an alphanumeric word (like &quot;test&quot;, for example) then no space is inserted. If you try to enclose it in quote marks they are stripped by Xcode before being passed to the preprocessor. If you try to escape the quote marks &#x2014; <tt>\\&quot;????\\&quot;</tt> &#x2014; then you get literal quote marks in your property list.</p>\n\n<p>Replace <tt>WO_DEFAULT_SIGNATURE</tt> in your property list with <tt>$(WO_DEFAULT_SIGNATURE)</tt> and you end up getting en empty string in your output. Same if you use <tt>${WO_DEFAULT_SIGNATURE}</tt>. If Apple improves the handling of property list preprocessing in a future release of Xcode I&apos;ll be able to get around the &quot;extra space&quot; problem by turning <tt>WO_DEFAULT_SIGNATURE</tt> into a build setting, using the <tt>$(WO_DEFAULT_SIGNATURE)</tt> format in the property list, and dumping the <tt>INFOPLIST_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS</tt> build setting.</p>\n\n<p>Problem solved and I only had to make three or four kludgey concessions (sigh). Time lost: about two hours. The joy of development.</p>\n</div></div>",

Safari beachballs.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000327more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>Wait a few seconds. Notice that Toast is still running and in the Dock. Control-click with the intention of quitting it seeing as the daily backup to DVD is now complete. No response. Dock freezes. &quot;Toast Titanium&quot; tool-tip frozen above its icon.</p>\n\n<p>Don&apos;t bother trying to use the Command-Tab application switcher because that&apos;s provided by the now-frozen Dock. Notice that the Toast window is partially visible so bring it to the front by clicking on it. Click on the &quot;File&quot; menu so as to select &quot;Quit&quot;. Witness as the menu does not open and Toast also freezes.</p>\n\n<p>Click on the time in the menu bar (which is still updating every second) so as to see the date. Witness as the menu extra freezes (beachballing).</p>\n\n<p>Knowing that Mac OS X is a delicate little beast, rather than pointing and clicking and making things worse, go have a shower and hope that the machine has come to its senses when you get back. This is a machine that you shut down over night and booted cleanly in the morning because you know that <a href=\"http://mjtsai.com/blog/2006/01/27/daily-reboot/\">daily reboots are good for the health of the system</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When you get back, notice that Xcode has joined the ranks of frozen applications. Try Option-Command-Escape to bring up the Force Quit dialog. Nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Notice that the Adium window is partially visible. Click on it to bring it to the front and tell your friend that very likely you&apos;ll soon be disappearing from his list of online contacts when you&apos;re forced to do an involuntary reboot. Witness as Adium starts to beachball before coming to the front.</p>\n\n<p>Notice that NetMonitor continues to update in the Dock, but that the network traffic has stalled, indicating that the hidden Azureus application has effictively stopped working.</p>\n\n<p>Notice that the CPU graph provided by the Activity Monitor in the graph, which up until now has shown that both 2.5GHz 64-bit CPUs have been idling away at about 1 or 2% utilization throughout this entire fiasco (although the machine&apos;s fans continued to roar at their usual hair-dryer volume the whole time), has stopped updating.</p>\n\n<p>Notice that the only window which doesn&apos;t show a beachball when you mouse over it is the one belong to Mail.app. Try clicking on that window. Beachball.</p>\n\n<p>Boot laptop. Ping the hung machine. It responds. Try to log in via SSH. Hangs. Do a portscan. The SSH port is open, but it doesn&apos;t allow you to connect.</p>\n\n<p>Depress the power key and perform a hard reset. Decide that just to be safe you&apos;ll follow your standard policy of booting from optical media and running Disk First Aid, seeing as <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2005/05/1041_kernel_pan.php\">neither Apple&apos;s journaling file system nor their software RAID implementation have proven to be adequate protection</a> in the past.</p>\n\n<p>Insert Tiger install disc. Reboot with &quot;C&quot; key held. Witness as machine boots back from startup disk anyway. Reboot again, this time forceably electing the start-up disk prior to initiating the reboot.</p>\n\n<p>Fire up Disk First Aid. Witness as it shows you a progress dialog instead of the usual list of volumes. The dialog says, &quot;Reconstruyendo fragmento del RAID &quot;disk0s4&quot;; in other words, &quot;Reconstructing RAID fragment&quot;. Start to get very nervous. Ask yourself, &quot;How many times is this machine going to screw me? How much hassle is it going to cause me despite my obsessive daily backup regimen, my UPS and RAID protection, my journaling file system, my avoidance of third-party software?&quot;. Ask yourself, &quot;Why is this happening to me when all I am trying to do is be productive, work hard (even on a Sunday afternoon) and get the next version of my software out to my customers?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Witness that the &quot;Tiempo resetante estimado para la reconstrucci&#xF3;n&quot; is clipped and you can&apos;t actually read the time remaining. Try resizing the dialog (it has a resize gadget); it cannot be resized.</p>\n\n<p>Note that this debacle started at roughly 5 PM and it&apos;s now already 5:50 PM. The progress bar is less than 10% complete and is not moving.</p>\n\n<p>Vow to never depend on Apple&apos;s software RAID again, and get a proper hardware RAID with your next machine. Long for the day when Apple will release said machine (Intel pro-desktop) and when you&apos;ll actually have the money to get said machine and said RAID.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7:30 PM:</strong> The rebuilding is complete and the RAID is shown as &quot;en l&#xED;nea&quot; (online). Now doing a verification of the volume. No errors reported. Fingers crossed.</p>\n\n<h4>Totals for this machine</h4>\n\n<p>9 kernel panics.<br>\n30 hard resets.<br>\nTotal time wasted in this incident: nearly 3 hours.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>It&apos;s amazing how hard it is to get temporary Internet access in Spain. Or permanent access for that matter. Earlier this month I decided to switch ISPs. On 9 May I sent a letter to my old provider notifying them of my desire to discontinue the service and on the same day I applied with a new provider.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000329more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>9 days later I got a letter from the new provider, signed the enclosed form and returned it. They advise that setting up new connections usually takes 30 days from the date on which they receive the signed form. So, best case scenario: 9 days to receive the form, 1 more day for them to get it back, plus 30 days to establish the connection; 40 days to get an ADSL connection. Last time I checked, Spain was not a developing nation but a developed one, and this <em>is</em> the 21st century, right?</p>\n\n<p>On 21 May my old provider notified me that I&apos;d be able to enjoy the benefits of my access until the end of the billing period shown on my last bill. That meant that my access would be cut off at the end of 26 May.</p>\n\n<p>With uncharacteristic efficiency, however, they decided to cut off access the very next day, depriving me of five full days of access. This is the only time in my entire history of dealings with ya.com that they&apos;ve actually done something before they said they would.</p>\n\n<p>Bearing in mind the 40-day prognosis for getting the new connection I decided to investigate getting temporary dial-up access in the meantime. I can go to Internet cafes with my laptop, but it&apos;s not very convenient or efficient. All of my data and software is here in the office. If I go to the Internet cafe once per day it means that there may be a delay of 24 hours or more (depending on the time of day that I go to the cafe) between customers sending me email and me actually reading it. If the query requires me to search back over my records then I won&apos;t be able to reply to the customer, will have to do the search back at the office, and then reply on my next trip the following day. So we are talking about 48 hours minimum turn-around time in that case. If the customer&apos;s query does not include sufficient details and I have to ask for more information then the issue can drag out to 72 or even 96 hours before getting resolved. I know that none of this is my fault, but even so I don&apos;t like making my customers wait that long and I&apos;m sure they don&apos;t like it either.</p>\n\n<p>So I try to get dial-up access. Would you believe how hard it is to get such access in Spain? Once again, I ask myself what century I&apos;m in...</p>\n\n<p>My first port of call was a Telef&#xF3;nica store on Gran V&#xED;a. It&apos;s easy, they say, all you have to do is install this software and you&apos;re set to go. The CD they handed me was for Windows only. Why should I have to install software to get dial-up access? That&apos;s what the System Preferences are for: entire access phone number, username, password, and you should be good to go.</p>\n\n<p>So I said I had a Mac and therefore couldn&apos;t use the CD. She advised me to go to the official Telef&#xF3;nica store in the Calle Mayor. The person in the official store couldn&apos;t help either, but she did point out that there was a support number on the disc and I could try calling that.</p>\n\n<p>I get home and try calling and am presented with a recorded greeting that tells me to try a new, different number, then hangs up in my ear. I call the new number and hear another recording that says that seeing as I am not a Telef&#xF3;nica ADSL customer, I should call my local provider, and then hangs up in my ear.</p>\n\n<p>I try calling my new provider to see if they can provide me temporary dial-up access why I&apos;m waiting for the ADSL. They cannot. Although they do provide dial-up access they provide it on a contract basis, not a temporary one, and it&apos;s not possible to apply for one contract-based plan when you&apos;re already in the process of getting another one hooked up. To find out this I had to call them about four times, by the way, because first the person I spoke to in one group told me I had to hang up and call again asking for another group; but then that group told me to hang up and call back the first group etc. Why can&apos;t they just transfer these calls internally? And why are they so incompetent that they don&apos;t even know with certainty which section should be handling my call? Incidentally, while waiting on hold I hear a recording that &quot;reminds&quot; me that ADSL connections usually take 30 to 35 days; 35 days eh? Bumped up by 5 days from the previous prediction, so that takes me to <strong>45 days total</strong> to get ADSL hooked up. In the 21st century. In Western Europe. Right.</p>\n\n<p>So I go over to my friend&apos;s house and try the Telef&#xF3;nica website. I sign up for their basic net access using their web form. Once again it tells me to download some Windows software in order to get connected. When I try to download the configuration instructions for Mac, the linked PDF turns out to be a document of zero bytes in length.</p>\n\n<p>I trawl the site for configuration instructions and manage to find some help documents with screenshots of configuration settings for Windows 95/98, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Linux (well, these aren&apos;t screenshots but command-line set-up instructions) and finally MacOS (but the screenshots are of MacOS 8/9). Some of the screenshots show DNS IP addresses that contradict the textual information on the same page. Of all the operating systems shown, none of them except for Windows XP show an access phone number. So I write down the access phone number.</p>\n\n<p>I also find a support phone number. I dial it and ask for confirmation of the access phone number. She tells me it&apos;s wrong and gives me the actual number. (Five days later on my twentieth call to Telef&#xF3;nica I&apos;m finally told that that number was wrong too and I&apos;m given yet another one.)</p>\n\n<p>Now I&apos;m all set to go, right? On getting home I try connecting with my shiny new dial-up access, but the system rejects my password. I try connecting using a terminal prompt just to be sure that everything is set up correctly and I verify that I am indeed getting a login and password prompt. I try a couple of variations of the username just to be sure but all are rejected.</p>\n\n<p>Time to call support again. Basically I want to find out if their is some kind of activation delay (I would have thought that activation would be totally automated and instant, like it is back in Australia), or whether I&apos;ve set something up incorrectly.</p>\n\n<p>So I call the number and again the system hangs up in my ear because I&apos;m not an ADSL customer. I call the general customer service number and try to speak to an operator. When I finally do get through to an operator I am told I need to hang up and call again and ask for &quot;Telef&#xF3;nica online&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>This is one of those charming automated systems in which a computer asks you questions and you respond orally instead of pressing buttons on your phone. It asks me for the reason for my call. I say I want to be connected to &quot;Telef&#xF3;nica online&quot;. I hear a recorded greeting saying that everything I need to know about Telef&#xF3;nica online can be found on their website, and it hangs up in my ear. Not very helpful when I am looking for tech support about getting online.</p>\n\n<p>I call back and tell the computer that I need to speak with an operator. The computer tells me it needs to know why I am calling. I tell the computer about how it keeps hanging up in my ear. Finally the computer decides to connect me to a human being. The human being listens to my story and manually transfers me to another human being in Telef&#xF3;nica online. Hooray!</p>\n\n<p>That human being informs me that my dial-up account isn&apos;t active yet, and that is why my username and password are being rejected. (Nearly a week later someone else in Telef&#xF3;nica who actually knows what he is talking about informs me that that&apos;s incorrect and that activation is instant, as I expected it would be.) She tells me I will receive an email once it is all hooked up. Hmmm... So how am I going to check this email, given that I don&apos;t have access, I wonder? I ask her to which address the notification will be sent. She tells me: wincent5@telefonica.net (wincent@telefonica.net was already taken, incredibly; how many Wincents are there in Spain anyway?). So let me get this straight: you are going to inform me that my account has been activated by sending an email to the account that you have promised to provide me but to which I won&apos;t have any access until you decide to provide me said access? Unbelievable...</p>\n\n<p>Given that such notification is entirely useless to me I ask her how long these activations normally take and she tells me she doesn&apos;t imagine it will be too long. Great. Thanks for the precise and detailed information.</p>\n\n<p>So I don&apos;t know when I&apos;ll be getting dial-up access, nor how long I&apos;ll be waiting before I get the ADSL back. Given the incompetence of everyone I&apos;ve had to deal with so far, there are no guarantees that the dial-up access will actually work, nor that Telef&#xF3;nica won&apos;t delay the transfer of my line to Jazztel because it&apos;s now &quot;encumbered&quot; with a dial-up access account as well. Sigh.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 29 May 2006:</strong> Finally after seven days of trying and countless frustrating phone calls have managed to get the dial-up access working. This is something that could have been solved on the very first day if I had spoken to somebody, anybody, that actually knew what he/she was talking about.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p><a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/05/involuntary_reb_1.php\">With the last batch of trouble</a> with my G5 I decided it was time to switch development over to my shiny new iMac. Although it is technically less powerful (only a 32-bit Intel Core Duo 1.83 GHz compared with a 64-bit dual  2.5 GHz G5) I suspect that performance will be almost as good for most things.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000330more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>It&apos;s a good time to sell a G5 in any case, before the new Intel-based pro-desktop machines come out and make the current crop of G5s look like undesirable, noisy paperweights.</p>\n\n<p>Ah the noise... or rather, the silence. The silence using the new iMac is golden, the noise of the hard drives purring almost imperceptible. If the machine has fans I&apos;ve never heard them. Now isn&apos;t that a great compliment? Not even knowing if the machine has fans at all?</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime my G5 sits behind me literally roaring like a hair dryer while I do a free-space wipe on it and prepare it for sale. It has done this blow-heater impression since new without any apparent rhyme or reason. The CPU load and ambient temperature seem to have all too little to do with the way the fans speed up and slow down with schizophrenic lability. That&apos;s partly what makes it so annoying: it&apos;s not only loud, it&apos;s variably loud. In any given 60-second period the fans may alternate between roaring, whining, complaining, blasting, surging and screaming, or any of a number of adjectives that describe annoying sounds. I can sleep with this noise only because I am accustomed to it, but when I have guests in my room I feel almost ashamed of the way the machine strives to drown out whatever music I might have playing in iTunes for their entertainment, or whatever DVD might be struggling to make itself heard over the din of the machine&apos;s blow-heater-like cooling system.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the noise factor alone is enough to make me thrilled to be selling this machine. Even though it supposes a step down in computing power. And I am a power addict.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that the new iMacs are very memory hungry: or rather, Mac OS X is memory hungry and the new iMacs are underequipped with only 512 MB of RAM.</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve found that it&apos;s basically a one-app machine. Performance is reasonable when running any single app at a time. But try to fire up two memory hungry apps and the machine slows to a crawl. It&apos;s evidently starved for memory because the CPU load remains very low, close to zero, but the user interface begins to behave as though it were buried under a sea of treacle and every action is accompanied by many seconds (up to 30) of disk thrashing. The worst of course is switching apps.</p>\n\n<p>Even Front Row doesn&apos;t work properly with so little memory. The delay between pressing a button on the remote and the machine actually responding can be several seconds long. This is not a very good experience. I think Apple made a mistake shipping these machines with only 512 MB. Mac OS X evidently needs 1 GB, minimum. Switchers are going to buy these machines and get utterly confused when their remote seems to stop working.</p>\n\n<p>Even the most basic usage pattern for me is impossibly slow with the standard configuration. Let&apos;s take the example of working in Xcode and having Mail open in the background. I frequently need to flip back and forth between the two. Firing up Mail only when I need it is not a viable option because I would spend half the day waiting for it to load.</p>\n\n<p>At boot time free physical memory is immediately down to only a few meg. With a few basic apps open (such as TextEdit and Activity Monitor) I can then launch the two heavyweights, Mail and Xcode. A freshly launched copy of Mail with a single mail box selected takes up about 60 meg of physical memory and 265 meg of virtual. Xcode with a single project open uses more and more memory even when it is just sitting there in the background (what is it doing? indexing?); on opening the project it uses about 40 meg of physical memory but left alone for a while it soon climbs to 50 meg. Virtual memory use starts off at about 257 meg. </p>\n\n<p>A serious app like Toast running under Rosetta uses 54 meg physical and nearly 500 virtual. Using this machine the number of page-in and page-outs grows steadily almost without cease. If I start a compilation job I can watch both figures steadily grow at the rate of about 100 every few seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Under these circumstances doing anything at all in Mail (such as switching mailboxes) becomes unbearably slow. Xcode remains relatively responsive at the user interface level, but compilation crawls along like a crippled turtle. A clean-and-build of Synergy Advance on the G5 took about 6.5 minutes. On the iMac my first test run took over 26 minutes (measured using <tt>time xcodebuild clean build -target &quot;Synergy Advance.app&quot; -configuration Release</tt>):</p>\n\n<pre>real    26m19.688s\nuser    5m36.100s\nsys     3m11.155s</pre>\n\n<p>So it became immediately apparent that if I was to live with this machine without hurling it from the second-floor balcony in a fit of rage that I would need more memory. It is no exaggeration to describe the machine as &quot;unusable&quot; with the amount of RAM that it ships with from the factory.</p>\n\n<p>It has two RAM slots, one of which ships with a 512 MB module from the factory. You can either stick another 1 GB module in the remaining slot to bring the total up to 1.5 GB, or throw out the old module (or sell it on eBay, or keep it as a spare) and get two 1 GB modules for a total of 2 GB. The manual offers instructions on how to perform the upgrade although it warns you can void your warranty if you make a mistake; evidently Apple is aware that the iMacs are memory impoverished because RAM is the only user-installable part that is mentioned in the manual and they took special pains at the design stage to make the memory slots accessible behind a small door on the bottom edge of the case secured by two conventional screws.</p>\n\n<p>Given my experience with the G5 (which had 2.5 GB) and with the 512 MB iMac, I concluded that the only option was to upgrade to the maximum, 2 GB. If upgrading to 4 GB had been an option I probably would&apos;ve considered it. I tried to get memory from the stores here in Madrid (seeing as I don&apos;t have net access at the moment, online shopping wasn&apos;t really an easy option) but it seems that the iMac&apos;s ultra-fast and compact PC2-5300 memory (DDR2 667) is as rare as hen&apos;s teeth here. So much for the benefits of standardisation... the standard evidently hasn&apos;t even arrived here yet. </p>\n\n<p>So in the end I had to go into the Internet cafe and order from my trusty online vendor, <a href=\"http://macsales.com/\">OWC</a> (Other World Computing). I have bought memory and hard drives from them many times over the years. This will mean a slight additional cost for freight but that will be more than outweighed by the better prices available when ordering from the US. And they&apos;re very quick. I placed the order yesterday (around lunchtime in Spain), and OWC immediately prepared the order (morning of the same day in the US); FedEx collected it early in the afternoon and shipped it off on the next hope that same evening. When I receive the memory I&apos;ll do another compilation time test.</p>\n\n<p>This is an interesting opportunity to do a comparison of memory prices over time because for the first time ever I&apos;ve ended up purchasing that same quantity (2 GB) at two widely-separated points in time. Normally I find that as memory prices go down I buy more memory; this time I&apos;ve bought a fixed quantity on two occasions.</p>\n\n<p>Back in October 2004 when I got the G5 my 2 GB of RAM, also ordered from OWC, cost me US$429.99, or $215.00 per gigabyte:</p>\n\n<blockquote>2GB PC3200 PowerMac G5 Memory Upgrade (2x1GB Matched Pair) DDR 400 MHz CAS 3.0 184 Pin 8-Layer TRUE PC3200 Modules</blockquote>\n\n<p>The 2 GB for the iMac, ordered just over a year and a half later, costs $225.00, or about $112.50 per gigiabyte:</p>\n\n<blockquote>2.0GB Matched Pair (1024MB (1GB) x 2) PC5300 DDR2 667MHz 200 pin SO-DIMM Modules</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve seen it even cheaper (as low as $80) elsewhere, but OWC is a reputable vendor with good service and I know them, so I preferred to stick with what I know.</p>\n\n<p>So it appears that memory has roughly halved in price over the last 18 months, in addition to getting smaller and faster, so &quot;Moore&apos;s Law&quot; is definitely holding true with respect to memory (even though the &quot;law&quot; as such was never conceived to be applied to memory).</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Since switching to the new iMac I&apos;ve been using <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/mightymouse/\">the Apple Mighty Mouse</a>. Things I like about it: looks great; lightweight; the scroll ball is brilliant.</p>\n\n<p>Two problems, however...</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000332more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h3>1. Right clicking</h3>\n\n<p>This is a zero-button mouse but in theory you can produce left and right clicks by pressing the appropriate side of the device. The problem is that it&apos;s fairly easy to get &quot;false lefts&quot; when what you actually mean to do is get a right click. Most common manifestation of this: when you right-click on an icon in the Dock hoping to get quick access to the item&apos;s Dock menu and you inadvertently end up switching apps. Switching apps is an annoying bottleneck that can rob you of precious seconds through disk-churning when you&apos;re using a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/05/memory_for_the.php\">memory-starved machine</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>2. You can&apos;t reposition the mouse during drags</h3>\n\n<p>Another consequence of the zero-button design: if you initiate a drag and reach the limit of possible movement (for example, the edge of the desk, the edge of the mouse mat, the edge of your cup of coffee, whatever) the standard thing to do would be to lift the mouse up off the desk with the button still depressed, reposition it so as to make extra space, and then continue the drag.</p>\n\n<p>This isn&apos;t possible with the Mighty Mouse because it has no buttons. As soon as you lift the mouse up off the desk you effectively release the pressure on the mouse body causing Mac OS X to think your intention is to release the clicking operation. As a result the dragged object ends up getting dropped in mid-drag.</p>\n\n<p>The only workarounds are to head up to the menu bar and stop the drag up there (this at least allows you to avoid dropping the object somewhere undesirable), buy a bigger desk, or use some kind of Jedi mind trick to convince the mouse that you&apos;re still pressing the button even when you lift it up off the desk.</p>\n\n<p>Of these two problems, the first one is probably the easiest to improve in the next rev of the Mighty Mouse. The second one, I can&apos;t see any way of doing it without abandoning the zero-button design, which would be a step backwards in terms of elegance. I guess I&apos;ll just have to make more room for my mouse.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>At the end of June this year I will be changing my email address. I wanted to post this article to give people plenty of notice. I&apos;m doing this for two reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, because my old address, <em>win@wincent.org</em>, has been plastered all over the Internet for about 7 years now and it attracts a fair amount of spam. Even with good filtering, the quantity is annoying because I still have to scan the filtered mail for false positives.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, I registered wincent.org in 1999 but since obtaining wincent.com (not sure exactly when, I think it was in 2002 or 2003) I have gradually been moving more and more aspects of my business over to the dot-com domain. It makes sense that outgoing mail should come from dot-com and not dot-org.</p>\n\n<p>So until the end of June this year I will continue to accept delivery at the old address. After that I will probably start bouncing mail and including the URL for <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/contact/mail/\">the contact form</a> in the bounce message.</p>\n\n<p>Effective immediately, all outgoing email will be coming from the new address. The new address is the same as the old address, except it&apos;s dot-com rather than dot-org. An updated copy of my PEM email certificate (encryption and signature verification) has been added to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/\">this page</a>.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000336more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

You can also elect to skip cleaning precompiled headers.</li>\n<li><strong>Option-double-click now works on symbols names in documentation windows:</strong> making it much, much faster to zoom around the documentation.</li>\n<li><strong>Clicking on symbols in the API listing now requires only a single click:</strong> thus fixing a long-standing regression in which you had to click twice (once to switch documents and then again to scroll the document to the appropriate anchor).</li>\n<li>And finally... <strong>Everything seems much faster...</strong> or am I just imagining it? A full <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> clean and build is still taking about six and a half minutes on the G5 (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/05/imac_memory_upg.php\">only 5 minutes on the iMac</a>) although admittedly I have added quite a bit of code since the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/03/automated_strip.php\">last time</a> I did that test; but movement in the editor and around the user interface definitely feels faster to me.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are all very real improvements that have a significant impact on my work flow (either eliminating blocker bugs, allowing me to remove kludges and workarounds, or simple helping me to work faster/better).

The whole reason I made the switch was because of that last scary episode, one scary episode too many... (Little did I know about the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/05/imac_memory_upg.php\">performance benefits</a>.) So that was 21 May 2006 (confirmed by looking at the volume creation date on the startup disk and also the creation date on <tt>/var/log/OSInstall.custom</tt>); the new machine didn&apos;t even get to the two month mark before hitting its first panic.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Operating system version:</strong> Mac OS X 10.4.7</li>\n<li><strong>Average time between failures:</strong> 53 days</li>\n<li><strong>Uptime at moment of failure:</strong> Less than one day</li>\n<li><strong>Kernel panics:</strong> 1</li>\n<li><strong>Hard resets:</strong> 0</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As always, the first thing I did was boot from the system install disc and run Disk First Aid; no errors found but the decision to boot from the DVD rather than the usual start-up disk probably explains why there was no <tt>panic.log</tt> anywhere to be found on the disk (searched everywhere, not just in <tt>/Library/Logs/</tt>. It would be handy to have that information but given my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/05/involuntary_reb_1.php#more\">terrible experiences with disk integrity</a> and Apple software in the past I prefer to not take any risks, and booting from a file system in a potentially inconsistent state sounds like asking for trouble.</p>\n\n<p>This is why I fervently hope the <a href=\"http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=14473\">rumours</a> about Apple supporting <a href=\"http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/\">ZFS</a> in the future are true, although I&apos;m not holding my breath as they have a large investment in HFS. Of course one of the largest benefits of ZFS in my view is its <a href=\"http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/docs/zfs_last.pdf\">failure handling capabilities</a>, greatly enhanced as you add more drives to the pool, and with an iMac you&apos;re always only going to have one internal drive; even so, looking forward to the day in the future where one will be able to stack four huge Serial-ATA drives in a new Mac Pro tower and use them as an incredibly robust and fast ZFS storage pool.</p>\n</div></div>",

I&apos;ve seen abstraction layers before but never anything so transparently, elegantly and extensively database agnostic. Amazing. Combine it with the incredibly easy deployment using Locomotive and SQLite and you&apos;re laughing.</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s early days yet but I can already see that this will deliver the &quot;rapid&quot; in &quot;Rapid Application Development&quot;, and being a Cocoa programmer I am already familiar and totally comfortable with the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, and Object-Oriented stuff in general. Sure, I don&apos;t know Ruby (yet) but I&apos;ve already got a few books and there is plenty of material online. (Is it just me or does Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson have one of <em><a href=\"http://media.rubyonrails.org/video/migrations.mov\">the most annoying voices in the history of the universe</a></em>? I find him almost unlistenable).</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I&apos;m documenting all of this on my wiki (which will soon enough replace the existing <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/knowledge-base/\">Knowledge Base</a>). And why am I exploring all this stuff in the first place? Basically because I&apos;ve got some improvements in mind for this website that I think will be benefit customers and other users. I can see that this framework really can enable rapid turn-around times and I&apos;ll hopefully be able to roll out some new functionality in the not too distant future.

Companies like GoDaddy sell domains very cheaply (dot-coms for $8.95, and often lower after discounts) and attempt to make the real money off value-added services like private registration. This is all fair enough and I think $2 per year would be a fair price for private registration.</p>\n\n<p>But GoDaddy doesn&apos;t work that way despite <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/low_price.asp?se=%2B&amp;ci=3834\">their rhetoric</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>There are no tricks in what we do, just good, old-fashioned, reliable business principles. Quite often we&apos;re asked if we bait our customers with low rates and then charge high renewal prices. Anybody that expects us to do that will be disappointed. We believe in the old saying, &quot;You can shear a sheep many times but you can only skin it once.&quot;</blockquote>\n\n<p>Private registration costs an absurd $8.99. If you can get a discounted price it will cost you a somewhat less ridiculous $4.99. If you register or transfer enough domains at once you&apos;ll even get it thrown in for free. But when it comes time to renew you&apos;ll find that <em>the renewal price for private registration is $8.99, no matter how many domains you renew, and how many years you renew them for</em>. That&apos;s right; trying renewing 10 domains for 10 years and GoDaddy will charge you 100 years of private registration at $8.99. If that&apos;s not a &quot;bait and switch&quot; I don&apos;t know what is. Unsurprisingly, information about renewal prices is awfully difficult to find on the GoDaddy website. GoDaddy claims:</p>\n\n<blockquote>[Y]our renewal rates will be no higher than the rate you paid when you initially registered your domain name, or what our registration rates were when you transferred your domain name to us ... the only exceptions would be if the price the registry charges us increased, or if you took advantage of a limited-time, special price.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sorry, sir, but that&apos;s one cock and bull story that I just don&apos;t buy. If you register a domain with GoDaddy be prepared to be punished at renewal time. It seems the only way to fight this is to transfer the domain to another registrar instead of renewing, and I strongly encourage you to do so; don&apos;t let GoDaddy skin you over and over again.</p>\n\n<p>The other mitigating tactic is to take advantage of cheap registration prices and do multiple-year registrations if you can. For example, if GoDaddy offers you cheap or free private registration and you need to register multiple domains, do it for as many years as possible. You can only hope that GoDaddy will have changed its slimy renewal practices by the time your renewal date comes around. Also remember that domains are definitely not going to get cheaper: as stated in <a href=\"http://news.com.com/Domain+name+price+hikes+come+under+fire/2100-1030_3-6081336.html\">this article</a> already linked to above, Verisign can and probably will be jacking up wholesale domain prices for all registrars by 7% annually. This is not a case in which market forces will drive prices down; domains are one thing on the net that are not going to get cheaper.</p>\n\n<p>Another tip is to search Google for &apos;<a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=godaddy+%22promo+code%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">godaddy &quot;promo code&quot;</a>&apos; whenever you buy a domain name. In general renewal codes are hard to come by but you can often get a good deal on initial registrations.</p>\n\n<p>Today I purchased a new dot-com domain name. I had no need for any other domains, and renewing my existing domains wasn&apos;t going to help me get a discount thanks to GoDaddy&apos;s policy of punishing existing customers. So my only hope for a good deal was getting a promo code and seeing if I could leverage a multi-year registration. The best codes for me today were <tt>gd50bbd90</tt> and <tt>HASH3</tt> (found <a href=\"http://forums.digitalpoint.com/showthread.php?t=29483&amp;page=18&amp;highlight=godaddy+%22promo+code%22\">here</a>, use them while they last).</p>\n\n<p>I registered the domain for 10 years: standard price $8.95 per year, special price reduced to $8.50 per year, then the 25 cent per year ICANN fee (unavoidable) and an additional discount of $15.50 over the 10 year period for a total of $72 or $7.20 per year. This is about as cheap as it gets for a dot-com domain; with those numbers GoDaddy is making only 95 cents per year. In addition, I paid $4.99 per year for private registration. Still too much and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/05/godaddys_renewa.php\">not as cheap as I&apos;ve been able to get it in the past</a> ($1.95) but at least it&apos;s something I won&apos;t have to worry about until 2016. And that&apos;s where the bandits who run GoDaddy make their money, because the $4.99 per year for private registration is close to 100% pure profit.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000365more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>I haven&apos;t been posting updates to the &quot;Mini-log&quot; (visible in the box on the left-hand side of my <a href=\"http://colaiuta.net/\">weblog</a>) lately because I&apos;ve been working on some big changes to the back end of the site (basically, a Rails re-write of <em>absolutely everything</em>). This is a huge task and I haven&apos;t wanted to make too many posts using the old tools knowing that I&apos;d just have to migrate everything in the future anyway.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000366more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>The problem</h4>\n\n<p>For a long time I haven&apos;t liked the fact that this website uses so many different pieces of software &#x2014; <a href=\"http://www.bugzilla.org/\">Bugzilla</a> for the <a href=\"http://bugs.wincent.com/\">bug tracker</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/\">Movable Type</a> for the weblog and weblog-like parts of the site, <a href=\"http://www.ubbcentral.com/\">UBB.threads</a> for the <a href=\"http://forums.wincent.com/\">forums</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html\">Mailman</a> for the <a href=\"http://lists.wincent.com/\">mailing lists</a>, Perl scripts for the registration back end, hand-coded PHP for the rest &#x2014; and none of them share a common authentication infrastructure, customization format or even a common language.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, if users want to retrieve a lost license code they enter their email address, but if they want to file a bug report and post in the forums they must create two accounts. Subscribing to a mailing list involves yet another password. It would be nice if users could have just one account and use it to access absolutely everything.</p>\n\n<p>The other problem is that all these separate technologies have no common parts, making customization difficult. Bugzilla is written in Perl, Mailman in Python, UBB.threads is written in PHP, and MovableType is written in Perl (with some PHP). I&apos;ve done my best to provide a consistent look and feel across the entire site but there are limitations.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, instead of keeping just one codebase up-to-date I&apos;m forced to track security patches and other updates for multiple pieces of software.</p>\n\n<h4>The solution</h4>\n\n<p>A couple of weeks ago I stumbled across the <a href=\"http://hogbaysoftware.com/\">Hog Bay Software</a> website and was impressed by two things: the uniform look and integration across the entire site (which <a href=\"http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/node/1413\">I soon learned</a> was powered by <a href=\"http://www.drupal.org/\">Drupal</a>), and their innovative and novel approach (what they call &quot;<a href=\"http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/node/75\">user-powered software</a>&quot;).</p>\n\n<p>I looked at Drupal (not for the first time) and decided it wasn&apos;t exactly what I was looking for. It&apos;s written in PHP (not my favourite), is probably too big and unnecessarily complicated for my needs, and it would be a lot of work to move to Drupal and I&apos;d still be faced with the problem of integrating my registration back end.</p>\n\n<p>But my desire for unifying everything into a single piece of software was as strong as ever and perhaps even stronger given that I had recently added <a href=\"http://www.mediawiki.org/\">MediaWiki</a> to the line-up of software powering my website (I finally gave in and admitted that a wiki would be a much better engine for the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/knowledge-base/\">Knowledge Base</a> part of the website; the new Knowledge Base is a fresh install of MediaWiki, almost empty, but you can <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/\">take a sneak peek at it here</a> if you&apos;re interested).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rubyonrails.org/\">Ruby on Rails</a> is a powerful web framework with the emphasis on <em>rapid</em> application development. Would it live up to the hype? Could I use it to write an entirely new website back end &#x2014; tantamount to writing my own issue tracker, forums software, weblog software, wiki software... a huge task in anyone&apos;s book &#x2014; in a not-inordinate amount of time?</p>\n\n<p>I decided to give it a try. So over the last few weeks I have been experimenting with Rails (ironically, requiring me to learn Ruby at the same time, but I can already see Ruby becoming my favorite scripting language). If the experiment works then you&apos;ll eventually see a brand new, unified website for which you can use a single account to access absolutely everything: forums, wikis, weblogs, issues (support tickets, bug reports, feature requests) and so on.</p>\n\n<p>If the experiment doesn&apos;t work then it just means that I&apos;ll have learnt Ruby and Rails for nothing... I don&apos;t think that&apos;s too high a price to pay. I&apos;m very impressed with what I&apos;ve learnt of Rails so far, and I believe it is possible to do what I want. The need to keep the project simple (doable by a single person) is constantly in my mind and I think it will lead to a very simple, clean interface (nothing like <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/bugs/query.cgi?format=advanced\">this</a>).</p>\n\n<h4>Event log</h4>\n\n<p>So although activity on the website has been minimal of late I&apos;ve actually been incredibly busy behind the scenes. It&apos;s really a case of too much work and not enough time to do it all.</p>\n\n<p>I mean to get the <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">Synergy</a> 3.0 update out in the first half of this month, but I&apos;ve also got a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/\">Synergy Advance</a> update 90% done which I&apos;d like to get out soon but that&apos;s been slowed down because I&apos;ve been working on a brand new, to-be-announced product that I expect to release in the first half of this month (about 75% done at this point). And there&apos;s another unreleased product (about 50% done) that has been hanging around on the back burner for a long while that I&apos;d like to get onto soon. Also on the &quot;must ship soon&quot; list are updates to WinHex (already done, but administrative chores have to be dealt with before release) and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/bansshee/\">Bansshee</a> (again, the software is done but before release I have to finish the documentation and supporting material).</p>\n\n<p>Also waiting in the wings: <a href=\"http://test.wincent.com/\">WOTest</a> (which I am thinking of renaming to WOSpec after seeing <a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8135690990081075324\">this presentation</a>; see also <a href=\"http://blog.daveastels.com/files/BDD_Intro.pdf\">this article</a>) and a new version of <a href=\"http://strings.wincent.com/\">Wincent Strings Utility</a> with powerful new InfoPlist preprocessing support and bugfixes. Both of these pieces of software are done and being used in-house here, but I haven&apos;t had the time to prepare release packages and all the supporting material that goes with them.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the latest notable activity (most recent activity first):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Movable Type 3.31 upgrade.</li>\n<li>Purchased a license for <a href=\"http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html\">SuperDuper!</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Upgrading_from_MySQL_4.1.20_to_4.1.21_on_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux\">MySQL upgrade from 4.1.20 to 4.1.21</a> (first attempt failed due to MySQL packaging flaw; second attempt with corrected package succeeded)</li>\n<li>Wrote tool for PHP-to-HTML conversion and preparation of Apple Help Indices.</li>\n<li>Bug fixes to <a href=\"http://strings.wincent.com/\">Wincent Strings Utility</a>.</li>\n<li><tt>WORegularExpression</tt>, a (<a href=\"http://www.pcre.org/\">PCRE</a>) wrapper class.</li>\n<li>Learnt the API for adding a contextual menu plug-in to the Finder.</li>\n<li>A huge amount of work on <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Combating_spam\">anti-spam measures</a>, requiring me to do a lot of learning about <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/kb/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;ns0=1&amp;redirs=0&amp;searchx=1&amp;search=Sendmail&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=0\">Sendmail</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>",

    "file": "content/blog/mock-objects-revisited",
    "html": "<p>This isn&apos;t the first time I&apos;ve written about mock objects in WOTest.</p>\n\n<p>I first added mocks back in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2005/06/mock_objects_in.php\">June 2005</a>. I later wrote about efforts to improve the mock object implementation by making it able to record literally any message at runtime, even if the message wasn&apos;t known at compile time. I was never able to make it truly dynamic;  or to put it another way, I was never able to create mocks at runtime that recorded and responded to non-existent selectors like, for example, an imaginary <tt>extrapolateBinaryMultiplicator:</tt> method in <tt>NSString</tt>.</p>\n\n<p>That was in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/02/more_than_i_eve.php\">February of this year</a>. Last night I started thinking about it yet again, still troubled by the fact that in a highly dynamic language like Objective-C I couldn&apos;t record messages at runtime without there being at least a skeletal implementation available.</p>\n\n<p>I haven&apos;t yet reached my goal, but I did at least have an idea for how to get there, kind of. I made a couple of very simple test programs and looked at the generated assembly, confirming that for unknown selectors the compiler does not generate a type string that could be used to generate a method signature. Now that I was utterly convinced that this true and that I haven&apos;t overlooked anything I was free to consider alternative pathways... If there was no way of prying the method signature out of information in the runtime or compiled into the program (because the information just isn&apos;t there... period) then there might be a way of getting this information into the runtime by other means.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000373more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>I realized that I could supply a type string to the mock in advance. So instead of having to write a skeletal method implementation if you want the mock to handle a not-yet-written method you can just tell the mock in advance to expect a particular selector. It looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre>[mock setObjCTypes:@&quot;@@:@&quot; forSelector:@selector(mysterySelector:)];</pre>\n\n<p>Needless to say, you need to know how to construct a type string but that&apos;s not too hard. The type string above indicates that the method returns an object (type <tt>id</tt>, indicated by the <tt>@</tt>), that it takes the two hidden arguments that are passed to all Objective-C methods, <tt>self</tt> (type <tt>id</tt>, again indicated by the <tt>@</tt>) and <tt>_cmd</tt> (type <tt>SEL</tt>, indicated by the <tt>:</tt>) and a third (non-hidden) argument of type <tt>id</tt> (again, <tt>@</tt>).</p>\n\n<p>In order for this to work elegantly the stub needs to know something about the mock. This is because stubs have a limited, per-message context whereas mocks have a wider, per-class context, and we&apos;re talking about class-wide attributes here (method signatures) so it is appropriate to store that information in the mock.</p>\n\n<p>It would be possible to store this state in the stub, but it would require some ugly searching on the part of the mock (searching all its stubs) to figure out if they know how to handle an unrecognized selector. Furthermore, if you store the state in the stub then you have to set it up for every single stub that you plan on using to send the unimplemented selector, and repetition is annoying.</p>\n\n<p>So the stub needs to know something about the mock. The Cocoa-approved design pattern for doing this without breaking encapsulation (too much) is to employ a delegate. So I&apos;ve made a change to the way mocks instantiated their stubs; all mocks now pass themselves to stubs as delegates. This means that the stubs can query the mocks easily and elegantly.</p>\n\n<p>That&apos;s the real roadblock problem solved: I can know generate method signatures for totally unknown selectors. The hard part now is building an invocation based on that method signature in the <tt>forward::</tt> method. It&apos;s hard because it requires me to parse the architecture specific <tt>margs_list</tt> that gets passed to <tt>forward::</tt>. Fiddly stuff, especially on the PowerPC, because it prepends the contents of a bunch of floating point registers to the <tt>margs_list</tt>. On Intel, in comparison, it looks fairly straight forward. There is no documentation for any of this aside from the Darwin source code, and it&apos;s written in assembly language. Oh the joy of it. So the bad news is that it&apos;s not going to be easy; the good news is that it is almost certain to be possible.</p>\n\n<p>So today I&apos;ve made a swathe of changes in preparation for this long-longed-for optional unimplemented selector support. A lot of work for a little convenience. What&apos;s the use of it? I guess it&apos;s more of an intellectual exercise than anything and I enjoy a challenge.</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve done a bit of a namespace clean-up (reducing the number of methods in the mock classes so as to reduce the likelihood of clashes with mocked classes), plenty of reformatting to take advantage of the extra column width (132 columns up from 80), fixed a potential bug, and implemented all but the nastiest bits of the <tt>margs_list</tt> parsing. With all the changes all the unit tests (self-tests, really) still pass, with the exception of a single test which will start to pass as soon as I get the parsing code done.</p>\n\n<h4>Update 16:30</h4>\n\n<p>Ok, the i386 case is now implemented. Still have to make sure that it works with all the tricky edge cases, so I&apos;ll be throwing lots pointers and structs and floats and doubles and pointers to floats and unions at it and seeing what happens.</p>\n\n<p>My main machine now is an Intel iMac (not a G5) in sight, so although I&apos;ll see what I can whip up for PowerPC I probably won&apos;t have much of an opportunity to test it extensively.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>A while ago <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/knowledge-base/archives/2006/01/locking_doublec.php\">I wrote about double-checked locking and memory barriers</a>. There are plenty of articles about this on the net. They generally show three examples.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000377more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>No locking</h4>\n\n<pre>if (!condition)\n{\n    do_something();\n    condition = YES;\n}</pre>\n\n<h4>Slow locking</h4>\n\n<pre>@synchronized (object)\n{\n    if (!condition)\n    {\n        do_something();\n        condition = YES;\n    }\n}</pre>\n\n<h4>Double-checked locking</h4>\n\n<pre>if (!condition)\n{\n    @synchronized (object)\n    {\n        if (!condition)\n        {\n            do_something();\n            condition = YES;\n        }\n    }\n}</pre>\n\n<p>These articles fall into two categories: those that say double-checked locking is the bomb, and those that point out that double-checked locking is an &quot;anti-pattern&quot; and doesn&apos;t actually work. The articles in this latter category often go on to explain how the use of memory barriers can cure the brokenness of the double-checked locking &quot;anti-pattern&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking (yet again) about all this and I suddenly realized why double-checked locking appears so attractive, and why it can be so hard to accept that it doesn&apos;t work. The problem is one of intuition. Look at the last two code examples again. The second one is identical to the first, except that it encloses everything in an <em>additional</em> check. How on earth could something that imposes an additional safety check actually end up being less safe? That&apos;s the point where your intuition may become your enemy.</p>\n\n<p>Put simply, the reason why the third example is dangerous is that the first check of the condition <em>is not synchronized</em> with the actual setting of the condition. The fact that there&apos;s a second check that <em>is</em> synchronized doesn&apos;t matter at all because that unprotected first check is enough to send your program into the danger zone.</p>\n\n<p>The peril is well-explained in many places (<a href=\"http://www.oaklib.org/docs/oak/singleton.html\">here, for example</a>) so I will only briefly state the problem here.</p>\n\n<p>Pretty much all new Macs are dual-core now. That means that two threads could be running on two cores, each operating with its own local copy of the <tt>condition</tt> variable in its cache. Furthermore, the compiler (and the CPU too) is free to interpolate temporary variables, re-order instructions or run them in parallel if it deems that the effect will be equivalent. In other words, code like this:</p>\n\n<pre>if (!condition)\n{\n    do_something();\n    condition = YES;\n}</pre>\n\n<p>May be turned into this:</p>\n\n<pre>if (!condition)\n{\n    condition = YES;\n    do_something();\n}</pre>\n\n<p>If two threads hit this same code at the same time it is possible that one of them may see <tt>condition</tt> as being <tt>YES</tt> even before <tt>do_something()</tt> has done its stuff. Putting a lock around the entire block is one solution. Using a memory barrier is another:</p>\n\n<pre>if (!condition)\n{\n    do_something();\n    WO_MEMORY_BARRIER();\n    condition = YES;\n}</pre>\n\n<p>The barrier prevents the compiler (or the CPU) from rescheduling across the fence. This means that <tt>condition</tt> can only be set to <tt>YES</tt> once <tt>do_something()</tt> has really done its stuff. The above code still needs a synchronization block to handle the case were two threads may race to <tt>do_something()</tt> for the first time:</p>\n\n<pre>@synchronized (object)\n{\n    if (!condition)\n    {\n        do_something();\n        WO_MEMORY_BARRIER();\n        condition = YES;\n    }\n}</pre>\n\n<p>But once again we&apos;re back in the always-lock camp. And if we&apos;re always locking do we even need the memory barrier? The answer is no; even if the instructions get reordered there&apos;s still no way for a thread to see <tt>condition</tt> as being <tt>YES</tt> unless the <tt>do_something()</tt> function has already finished.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let&apos;s looked at the double-checked pattern again, this time with the memory barrier in place:</p>\n\n<pre>if (!condition)\n{\n    @synchronized (object)\n    {\n        if (!condition)\n        {\n            do_something();\n            WO_MEMORY_BARRIER();\n            condition = YES;\n        }\n    }\n}</pre>\n\n<p>If the memory barrier weren&apos;t there then you can see what might happen. In an ideal world one thread can enter the synchronized section, call <tt>do_something()</tt> and set the condition. A second thread asking if <tt>condition</tt> is <tt>YES</tt> knows that it can only be <tt>YES</tt> if <tt>do_something()</tt> is finished.</p>\n\n<p>In the real world, however, things are different. The compiler could reorder the instructions in the synchronized section. The first thread could set the condition before calling <tt>do_something()</tt>. A second thread could therefore see <tt>condition</tt> as being <tt>YES</tt> too early, undertake some action which depends on <tt>do_something()</tt> being done, and disaster can ensure. The memory barrier saves us from this.</p>\n\n<p>The problem of working on multiple cores which may have multiple caches still remains. Even with the memory barrier in the synchronized section protecting us from undesired instruction reordering, there is still the possibility that a thread on one core could set <tt>condition</tt> to <tt>YES</tt>, but a thread on another core will continue to see it as <tt>NO</tt>, at least until the caches are resynchronized.</p>\n\n<p>This latter problem can be addressed by inserting an additional barrier before the first check of the condition; this forces a resynchronization across all components of the system (caches, cores, main memory):</p>\n\n<pre>WO_MEMORY_BARRIER();\nif (!condition)\n{\n    @synchronized (object)\n    {\n        if (!condition)\n        {\n            do_something();\n            WO_MEMORY_BARRIER();\n            condition = YES;\n        }\n    }\n}</pre>\n\n<p>What&apos;s actually happening here? Basically, when running on two cores the ordering restrictions imposed on one core may not necessarily be visible to code running on the other core (or cores). For this reason memory barriers should always be paired when working in an SMP context (and Mac OS X is well and truly an SMP context). Most often this is seen in the pairing of a read barrier with a write barrier.</p>\n\n<p>Expressed in human terms, let say we have a bunch of stores (writes to memory) that are ordered into two groups, &quot;store A, B and C&quot; and &quot;store X, Y and Z&quot;, with the aid of a write memory barrier. This means that although the stores of A, B and C may occur in any order, they are guaranteed to occur before the stores of X, Y and Z (which may themselves occur in any order).</p>\n\n<p>A read barrier is required in order for this ordering to be perceived by a thread running on another core. Otherwise the thread is free to perceive the stores in literally any order.</p>\n\n<pre>Core 1                      Core 2\nStore A\nStore B\nStore C\nWO_WRITE_MEMORY_BARRIER\nStore X\nStore Y\nStore Z                     Load A\n                            WO_READ_MEMORY_BARRIER\n                            Load X</pre>\n\n<p>Here the read memory barrier ensures that the ordering effects imposed by the write barrier on the first core and correctly perceived by the second core. In other words, it is not only guaranteed that A will be stored before X on the first core, but also that that ordering will be perceived on the second core as well.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of our double-checked locking example, the same effect can be achieved more efficiently using only read and write barriers rather than fully bi-directional barriers:</p>\n\n<pre>WO_READ_MEMORY_BARRIER();\nif (!condition)\n{\n    @synchronized (object)\n    {\n        if (!condition)\n        {\n            do_something();\n            WO_WRITE_MEMORY_BARRIER();\n            condition = YES;\n        }\n    }\n}</pre>\n\n<p>For more information on memory barriers in SMP contexts I recommend <a href=\"http://kerneltrap.org/node/6431\">this article</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So there you have it... yet another article in the &quot;double-checked locking is broken unless you fix it with memory barriers&quot; meme. I guess everyone has to write one to really understand it.</p>\n\n<h4>Update: 18 February 2007</h4>\n\n<p>Here is <a href=\"http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/archives/2007/02/17/barrier/\">the take by</a> Peter Ammon, <a href=\"http://weblog.scifihifi.com/2005/05/26/say-hello-to-ridiculous-fish/\">an Apple engineer on the AppKit team</a>.

    "html": "<p>GoDaddy continues <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/07/godaddy_scam.php\">to scam</a> with respect to private registrations but I&apos;ve found one way to get around it.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000380more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>I used to have 32 domains registered with GoDaddy. A while back I <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/05/godaddys_renewa.php\">let one of them go</a> due to my dissatisfaction with GoDaddy&apos;s &quot;bait and switch&quot; pricing policy: get &apos;em in with cheap prices and then gouge &apos;em on renewal. I preferred to forgo the domain rather than give in to their bandit tactics.</p>\n\n<p>This is manifested at its worst in their private registration scams, recently taken to new heights. Back when I first wrote about this I got some feedback from a GoDaddy employee:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Hello, i currently work for godaddy dot com so i have a baiesd opinion.\nbassicly i read the part about privacy, i agree. it is actually an icann\npolicy that forces who is infromation to be avalible. the process of\nkeeping domains private can get costly though. not for your everyday\naccount, but we do have to offer the infromation to certan groups (the\npolice, people with court orders, ect..). thus fieling and going over\npaperwork for thousands of requests can cost some money. $2 is a fair\nprice i suppose. anyway have a nice day, your site is really cool. (i work\ntech support so we may talk one day.)</blockquote>\n\n<p>He has a valid point: providing privacy is a service and it&apos;s not reasonable to expect that service to be free. In addition to the costs he mentions there is also the cost of maintaining an email forwarding service with effective spam filtering for millions of domains. Admittedly this running cost must be fairly small, but I think $2 per year is a fair price to pay. But $8.99? I don&apos;t think so...</p>\n\n<h4>The latest scam</h4>\n\n<p>The latest scam is that GoDaddy offers you a &quot;special price&quot; of $4.99 on private registration when you&apos;re on the way to the checkout to renew your domains, but then pulls the plug and tries to charge you $8.99 when you actually get there.</p>\n\n<p>I contacted GoDaddy support about this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>I just tried to renew six domains. The bulk-pricing list shows me that when renewing more than 5 domains I should be able to renew my privacy for $4.99. But when I get to the checkout the system wants to charge me $8.99 for privacy. The advertised prices are here:<br>\n<br>\nhttps://dcc.godaddy.com/Domains/DomainBulkPriceDisplay.aspx<br>\n<br>\nI got to that link by clicking on a link which said &quot;Renewing more than 5 domains at once will automatically qualify for special bulk pricing&quot;.<br>\n<br>\nSo what do I have to do to get this special bulk pricing to apply to my order of 6 domains?</blockquote>\n\n<p>And received this reply:</p>\n\n<blockquote>The special pricing for privacy only applies to new orders of privacy. Renewals are only avaliable for discounts on the domain name only not the privacy. I am sorry if there was any confusion. If there is anything else we can do to help let us know. Have a great day.</blockquote>\n\n<p>I subsequently complained but haven&apos;t yet received a reply (several days have passed):</p>\n\n<blockquote>It appears that the information on your site is misleading then:<br>\n<br>\nhttps://dcc.godaddy.com/Domains/DomainBulkPriceDisplay.aspx<br>\n<br>\nNote that the table is titled &quot;Bulk *Renewal* Pricing&quot; and the row that says &quot;Privacy&quot; indicates that the cost is $4.99 per year. That table clearly gives the impression that the price is $4.99 when renewing. The table does not list a separate, higher price for renewing privacy.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, if I do the following:<br>\n<br>\n1. Log into my account<br>\n2. Click on &quot;My Domain Names&quot; from the &quot;Domains&quot; drop-down menu<br>\n3. Select more than 5 domains and press the &quot;Renew Domains&quot; button<br>\n<br>\nYour website shows me a message stating, &quot;Renewing more than 5 domains at once will automatically qualify for special bulk pricing&quot;, and clicking on the link takes me to the price list for which I&apos;ve already provide a link.<br>\n<br>\nJust below this the page says, &quot;Choose a Public or Private Registration&quot;, and further down, &quot;Today&apos;s Special! Just $4.99/yr. per domain&quot; (screenshot attached as proof).<br>\n<br>\nOnce again this clearly gives the impression that the price is $4.99. If that is not the case, why then does GoDaddy go out of it&apos;s way to make the offer? Your site is showing this offer to me as a logged in user who has indicated which domains he wishes to renew; there were no non-renewal domains selected and no non-private domains selected. If the offer does not apply to any of the selected domains then GoDaddy shouldn&apos;t be showing it only to later withdraw it.<br>\n<br>\nSo basically this amounts to false advertising. What can I do to obtain the advertised price? It seems you should either withdraw the misleading offer or provide a means for customers to actually take you up on it.<br>\n<br>\nI await your clarification on if there is anything I can to do obtain the advertised offer.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>The workaround</h4>\n\n<p>Well, it turns out there is a workaround. This time around the domains in question were important ones (such as wincent.org) that I couldn&apos;t let slip by, so I decided that I would rather forgo my privacy then give in to GoDaddy&apos;s trickstering. I have a post office box address so I can at least allow my WHOIS information to be public without disclosing my residential or work address.</p>\n\n<p>I figured I would renew the domains for one year without privacy and then renew them again shortly after with privacy added back on.</p>\n\n<p>I checked the &quot;public listing&quot; box on the way to the checkout, and lo and behold, GoDaddy wanted to charge me $8.99 for &quot;privacy renewal&quot;. It is to laugh.</p>\n\n<p>Off to <a href=\"http://domainsbyproxy.com/\">Domains By Proxy</a> (really just another GoDaddy website) to cancel the privacy on the domains. Then back to GoDaddy to renew the domains; but this time seeing as they were &quot;public&quot; I was able to &quot;add&quot; privacy for $4.99. That combined with the <tt>TODD</tt> 10%-off coupon code that I found <a href=\"http://www.dealtaker.com/GoDaddy-coupon-code-a528-c40.html\">here</a> meant that I was able to renew 6 domains with privacy for $79.97. In the end it worked out better this way because I didn&apos;t have to do the double-renewal trick that I was contemplating and my domains were only non-private for a couple of minutes. Immediately after renewing I checked the WHOIS database and all the domains had been extended by a year and all of them had the private registration information intact.</p>\n\n<p>This really does underline the lunacy of it all. You somehow claim that renewing a service is more costly than setting it up from scratch. As a result, I required you to cut off the service and then set it up all over again in order to get the lower price. And somehow that works out cheaper for you? I don&apos;t follow the logic... but wait a second... I&apos;m beginning to see the light... All that stuff on your website about being good guys and not doing &quot;bait and switch&quot; is a bald-faced lie: this is classic &quot;bait and switch&quot;; get &apos;em in cheap and then bleed &apos;em dry.</p>\n\n<p>Of course the instantaneous manner in which I was able to first cancel privacy on six domains and then set it up again immediately shows that this service is provided in an entirely automated fashion, costing you almost nothing to run.</p>\n\n<p>So GoDaddy, I hope you mend you ways. Start charging reasonable prices for private registration renewals (try $1.99). Stop &quot;rewarding&quot; your loyal customers with a $8.99 gouge-in-the-eye. And if you decide not to mend your ways, don&apos;t think it&apos;ll net you any profits. I&apos;ll either use a workaround like the one mentioned here (or find another), drop the privacy on the domain, or just drop the domains entirely. You might not lose in the end, but at least you won&apos;t be winning at my expense.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>I like to experiment with different licensing models. In the past I&apos;ve released applications as closed-source commercial software, shareware both with and without serial numbers, with and without product activation, open source free software (with the possibility of donations) under a variety of licenses (BSD, Omni Source License, the GPL), and binary-only &quot;freeware&quot; (public domain).</p>\n\n<p>Each of these has its strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000381more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>Open source/free software, for example, is good for public relations but not so good for the bank account; at least that&apos;s the way it is with very small (one-person) open source projects: one person does all the work and can expect little or nothing (<em>really</em>, nothing) in the way of collaboration from outside, and the income is in general insufficient to cover the distribution costs let alone the development time. Basically, the only reason I can afford to do any open source work is that I do non-open source work too.</p>\n\n<p>Closed-source, non-free software tends to be better from an income perspective, and you can place your product anywhere along a compliance enforcement spectrum that ranges from &quot;no enforcement&quot; to &quot;dongles, hand-cuffs, and oaths signed in blood&quot;. In my experience &quot;honesty&quot; systems basically don&apos;t work (of the type, &quot;check the box if you&apos;ve purchased&quot;); you need some kind of enforcement. Serial numbers generally have a huge positive impact on sales, although cracks are a constant threat. Activation schemes have to be extremely well-thought out and executed if they are to meet their goal of increased license compliance without annoying your customers.</p>\n\n<p>So for the new product I was toying with the idea of trying a model I hadn&apos;t used before: instead of the &quot;download the demo and unlock full functionality upon purchase&quot; model I wondered if it might be worth distributing something that really was only a demo (no unlocking), and the purchaser would be able to download a full, unlimited copy upon purchase. Cracks would be no threat because the demo really would be just a demo. But to compensate the customer for the inconvenience of having to download two different programs (the demo and the real thing) the full version wouldn&apos;t have any serial number or license code. The risk there would be a full version somehow &quot;leaking&quot; out into the wild and getting shared among pirates, but I was still curious to see how it might work out.</p>\n\n<p>In the end though there&apos;s been one factor that has squished the idea of trying out the new model: the application in question requires an installer. I&apos;d feel ok about asking customers to download two programs, a demo and a full version, but I wouldn&apos;t feel ok about asking them to <em>install</em> twice. It&apos;s just too much hassle, no matter how slick the installer is.</p>\n\n<p>So yesterday and today I&apos;ve been working on refactoring my licensing engine (the same one used in Synergy Advance) out of WOBase and into WOCommon. I didn&apos;t want to just use WOBase because its quite a large framework now and the application I&apos;m talking about is lightweight. This is code I started working on in 2003 and has undergone many iterations since that time. I figure that after investing so much time and effort in it that I&apos;ll do well to put it into a form that I can use it in more easily in more products.</p>\n\n<p>One side effect of the refactoring is that it&apos;s not just moving stuff around: whenever you refactor you also review your code with fresh eyes; tighten things up, make them more elegant, perhaps squish a bug or two, write a test for a missing corner case that you spot... </p>\n\n<p>The good news about using the existing licensing engine is that all the infrastructure is already tested and in place, so I&apos;ll be able to release the product sooner. You see, I am due to go on a short holiday for about five days later this month; and I was reluctant to release any new products before going away because I wanted to be &quot;on deck&quot; to field any inquiries. Using the tried-and-tested infrastructure means I can be away with limited access and know that the automated transaction handling routines, license code mailers, and lost registration interface will all just work.</p>\n\n<p>Now the only thing that can stop me from releasing the app before I go away is not getting the first version of documentation and the website done in time...</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>There are two kinds of problems in computer programming: stimulating ones and annoying ones. The former are generally the problems you face when inventing something new; the latter are the ones you face when your development tools suddenly start behaving like unruly children.</p>\n\n<p>Tonight I&apos;ve had to deal with an annoying one.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000391more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>Code that&apos;s been working for months suddenly stops working. The first thing you try to do is run it under the debugger to see what&apos;s going wrong. It works perfectly. So you realize that this is a problem which only happens in release builds.</p>\n\n<p>This is annoying because the code in question is identical. There are no <tt>#ifdef</tt> directives or anything else which would cause the generated code to be different in the release build.</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s doubly annoying because by definition you can&apos;t run release code in the debugger (no debugging symbols available). You try anyway but it doesn&apos;t work. So instead of using the debugger you have to use old-fashion <tt>NSLog</tt> statements to find out where the code is falling down. Doubly annoying because after you&apos;ve sprayed these statements over the problem section you&apos;ll only have to go back and remove them all by hand later on.</p>\n\n<p>You eventually find the point of failure and through analysis discover that the failure is occurring because of a missing symbol. Annoying because the linker complained of no missing symbols. But armed with that knowledge you can start digging around with <tt>nm</tt> seeing the differences between the release build and the debug build. Why are the symbols missing? You turn off stripping and the release build still doesn&apos;t work. You examine the executable and the necessary symbols are still missing.</p>\n\n<p>Finally after a good two hours of painstaking hunting you decide to see if dead-code stripping is the culprit. Lo and behold, it is. The symbols that you&apos;ve explicitly marked for exporting have been culled by dead-code stripping. So you rewrite your <tt>EXPORT</tt> macro definition from:</p>\n\n<pre>#define EXPORT __attribute__((visibility(&quot;default&quot;)))</pre>\n\n<p>To:</p>\n\n<pre>#define EXPORT __attribute__((used)) __attribute__((visibility(&quot;default&quot;)))</pre>\n\n<p><tt>nm</tt> now confirms that the symbols are there and the release build starts working again. It&apos;s now 5 AM. Sure, perhaps I should have realized sooner, but one does one&apos;s best. Better still I would have written the <tt>EXPORT</tt> macro like that the first time around.</p>\n\n<p>This kind of problem is annoying rather than stimulating because there&apos;s no logic involved in it. It&apos;s not an intriguing puzzle. It&apos;s not like a game of Sudoku or trying to figure out a new algorithm. It doesn&apos;t involve writing any code (except for the ugly <tt>NSLog</tt> statements with which you are obliged to pepper your code). It doesn&apos;t feel like a creative struggle; rather, it feels like a struggle <em>against</em> the tools which are supposed to be enabling you, and pointless struggle too because you&apos;re doing all this stuff just to fix something broken that used to work fine last month, and you hadn&apos;t touched anything to break it. Instead of having a couple-hundred lines of new code to look back at the end of your labours all you have is an empty feeling and a slight headache.</p>\n\n<p>You can point the finger at the Apple documentation which suggested you write your macro like that (inadequately) in the first place. Or you can blame yourself for not reading the dead-code stripping documentation carefully enough, or for not having it in mind when the problem started. Or you can blame the fact that you&apos;re working with a large and complex system, and it&apos;s just been luck that you&apos;ve not run into this issue in the past. Whatever the case, it&apos;s not fun.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "file": "content/blog/thoughts-on-higher-order-messaging",
    "html": "<p>I&apos;ve never used Higher Order Messaging (HOM) but I am familiar with what it is. The main benefit of HOM is that it allows you to reduce lengthy code sections like this:</p>\n\n<pre>NSEnumerator *enumerator = [array objectEnumerator];\nNSMutableArray *temp = [NSMutableArray array];\nid string = nil;\nwhile ((string = [enumerator nextObject]))\n{\n    if ([string hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;])\n        [temp addObject:string];\n}\nNSArray *result = [NSArray arrayWithArray:temp];</pre>\n\n<p>Into this:</p>\n\n<pre>NSArray *result = [[array select] hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>Which is clearly more readable and easier to maintain. HOM advocates will tell you that the &quot;select&quot; idiom reads like natural language, and that&apos;s why it&apos;s so easy to understand and use.</p>\n\n<p>But it&apos;s not all roses. The compiler will issue a warning when it sees that above statement because as far as it is concerned (unless you tell it otherwise with category declarations in headers, macros, or casts) the <tt>hasPrefix:</tt> method returns a <tt>BOOL</tt> (an integer type) rather than an object (a pointer type). Not just a warning in fact, the compiler and the runtime may even go so far as to conspire and mangle the returned object for you to the extent that the example doesn&apos;t even work without some hideous runtime hackery. The problem is so bad that one of the most oft-cited and celebrated uses for HOM (the &quot;select&quot; pattern) simply cannot be implemented in a clean, non-kludgey way.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000392more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>But it&apos;s not just the compiler that feels uncomfortable with this construction. I don&apos;t either, even though I understand what&apos;s happening behind the scenes. You see, with a language that supports HOM as a fundamental part of the language (Smalltalk, for example), HOM looks &quot;right&quot;. A similar paradigm is the block syntax offered by Ruby, although strictly speaking that&apos;s not really HOM; rather it&apos;s anonymous inline functions which allow you to achieve a similar effect.</p>\n\n<p>But in Objective-C where HOM effectively has to be shoehorned into the language things don&apos;t look &quot;right&quot; to me. You see, when I see messages chained together in Objective-C I&apos;ve learnt to recognize a basic pattern:</p>\n\n<pre>[[[NSString alloc] init] autorelease];</pre>\n\n<p>Or:</p>\n\n<pre>[[[thing doSomething] andThenThis] andThenThat];</pre>\n\n<p>When the leftmost entity is a class you recognize this is a factory method that churns something out, and each subsequent message is going to add to, modify, or build on that something. When the leftmost entity is an object you see each message as adding to, modifying or building on whatever got returned by the first message.</p>\n\n<p>But with HOM that pattern no longer applies. It reads like natural language but behind the scenes there&apos;s an invisible trampoline object that does the work. The first message returns this invisible object with which you never need interact knowingly, and that invisible object mysteriously captures the message that you send it, the message that you really want to send to the objects in the collection, and then it does something with it.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, it works; yes, it allows you to write shorter, more compact code using a natural-language style. But it just feels wrong. I don&apos;t know if I&apos;ve explained myself; I guess the fundamental difference for me is that in the typical pattern examples I gave above there is nothing hidden, it&apos;s all out in the open. This &quot;honesty&quot; is manifested throughout almost all Objective-C code, you experience it hundreds of times every day that you code. At each step in the chain you know exactly what kind of object has been returned and the effect of each message. There is no trickery or sleight of hand, no hidden proxies, just a clear chain of object/message pairs. The fact that I know how HOM works and I know what the invisible objects doing the real work are doesn&apos;t make me feel any more comfortable with it.</p>\n\n<p>I know that this is what proxies do. I use them myself in my WOTest framework (to implement mock objects). But it still doesn&apos;t feel right to me. Proxies feel right when you&apos;re sending messages to remote objects across a network or in other processes or threads, but not when you&apos;re sending a message to a local instance of <tt>NSArray</tt>, so close that you could touch it and all of the objects inside it. If I could think of a better way to do mock objects I would throw out the HOM-style messaging syntax in a heartbeat. I mean, the following code works, it&apos;s compact, it&apos;s intention is clear, but it just feels wrong to me:</p>\n\n<pre>[[mock expect] returning:@&quot;foo&quot;] substringfromIndex:3];</pre>\n\n<p>A long-winded alternative, something like the following, doesn&apos;t set off those same alarm bells:</p>\n\n<pre>[mock expectSelector:@selector(substringFromIndex:)\n              return:@&quot;foo&quot; \n           arguments:3];</pre>\n\n<p>(Although in reality such a method &#x2014; one that accepts a variable number of arguments &#x2014; would come up against the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/02/more_than_i_eve.php\">same problems</a> that any <tt>NSInvocation</tt>-based mechanism comes up against when it comes to trying to forward messages when working with variable numbers of arguments.)</p>\n\n<p>That&apos;s why I haven&apos;t embraced HOM yet. That, and the fact that it works at such a low level that Apple could break it at any time in a future OS update. (To be fair, I should qualify that statement and say that &quot;most <em>existing</em> implementations could be broken at any time in a future OS update&quot;; it is possible to implement most HOM patterns in an unoptimized way without relying on too many low-level runtime details.)</p>\n\n<h4>Addendum</h4>\n\n<p>And as a side note, the code comparison that I posted above wasn&apos;t really fair. I would really write the first example as follows, using my <tt>WO_ENUMERATE</tt> macro and an <tt>array</tt> method in a category on <tt>NSMutableArray</tt> to make things a little less painful:</p>\n\n<pre>NSMutableArray *temp = [NSMutableArray array];\nWO_ENUMERATE(array, string)\n{\n    if ([string hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;])\n        [temp addObject:string];\n}\nNSArray *result = [temp array];</pre>\n\n<p>From activity in the GCC CVS repository it looks like Objective-C 2.0 will support a new <tt>foreach</tt> keyword anyway, or syntactic sugar for <tt>for</tt> which makes it behave like <tt>foreach</tt> , rendering even tricks like the <tt>WO_ENUMERATE</tt> macro unnecessary:</p>\n\n<pre>NSMutableArray *temp = [NSMutableArray array]\nfor (NSString *string in array)\n{\n    if ([string hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];\n        [temp addObject:string];\n}\nNSArray *result = [temp array];</pre>\n</div></div>",

Instead of hunting for where the searched term appears on a page (sometimes a nuisance when your highlight color is yellow and the page is white, for example), Safari employs some Quartz magic and tints the whole page with the exception of the matching search criteria, making them very easy to spot.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>&quot;Cool&quot;, &quot;neat&quot; and &quot;nice&quot; stuff</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;A new View Option in Leopard lets you specify Grid Spacing, so more (or fewer) icons fit in one window.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;Mail 3.0 (840.1/840) now supports RSS feeds.&quot;: it will probably displace Safari as my RSS tool of choice.</li>\n<li>&quot;The Help menu has gained some Spotlight functionality across all applications. Users can now easily invoke menu commands from Help, which tells you where you can find the command and will even point it out to you if you like.&quot;: I rarely use help myself but as a developer I think this will be great for my users, and provides a strong incentive to bundle help documentation inside the app rather than leaving it online.</li>\n<li>&quot;The Trash window finally sheds its identical appearance to other Finder windows, making it easier to identify that it&apos;s the Trash, as well as adding a button for emptying it from the window itself.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Disappointing</h4>\n\n<p>Looks like my initial hopes that Time Machine was built on top of ZFS were unfounded. A bit of a shame, but who knows what more awaits between now and release?

Every joke I tried that wasn&apos;t funny is recorded, as is every sarcastic comment or annoyed utterance.</p>\n\n<p>Back when I started none of this mattered, but in the age of Google there is is no such thing as comfortable anonymity. This is partly why I never make posts to mailing lists like <a href=\"http://lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/cocoa-dev\">cocoa-dev</a>. I have a corporate image to uphold; maybe it&apos;s stupid vanity but I just don&apos;t want the author of <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">Synergy</a> to be seen asking dumb questions about Cocoa Bindings. Sadly, this means I&apos;m a lurker.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000399more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>If I had known then what I know now I would never, ever have posted to a mailing list or a newsgroup with anything other than a throwaway address. Just think of all the spam I could have avoided...</p>\n\n<p>So my advice is this: subscribe to mailing lists and news groups using only throwaway email addresses. Once the spam starts to roll in you can just dump the old address and move on to a new one.</p>\n\n<p>There are two possible strategies, each with its pros and cons. In the first, you create a different address (or alias) for each mailing list and in that way have more fine-grained control. If one of the addresses starts receiving spam then you need only migrate that one, not all the others. The downside to this is that you must set-up and maintain multiple accounts/aliases, and in having multiple addresses you also increase the number of potentially targets for spammers. That&apos;s why it is important to use pseudo-random addresses which spammers are unlikely to guess; in other words, &quot;yookexai@wincent.com&quot; is better than &quot;john@wincent.com&quot; or even &quot;cocoa-dev@wincent.com&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>You see, if you include the name of the mailing list in the address then you make it easier for spammers to guess deliverable addresses. Same goes for when you have to put your email address into a web form. Instead of creating an alias like &quot;microsoft.com@wincent.com&quot; create one like &quot;aefoofon-microsoft.com@wincent.com&quot; which includes a pseudo-random component. The <tt>pwgen</tt> commandline utility is great for this (<a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/pwgen/\">SourceForge project page</a>); for this purpose I invoke it with the <tt>-A</tt>, <tt>-0</tt> and <tt>-B</tt> switches to produce strings with no capital letters, no numbers, and no ambiguous characters.</p>\n\n<p>The other approach is to use a single account for all your mailing lists. The benefit is that you only have to create one account; the downside is that if you start to get spam then you have to update every single mailing list subscription to a newly created address and that can be very time consuming if you have a lot of subscriptions.</p>\n\n<p>In the long run a hybrid approach may be the best. If you&apos;re subscribed to a read-only list (announcements) then you don&apos;t need to create full accounts; you can get away with aliases. If the alias gets compromised then you can painlessly update it. A prerequisite for this approach is that the mailing list software allow you to confirm your email address by clicking on a link in the confirmation email (<a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html\">Mailman</a> is one such piece of software, and fortunately it is very popular). Other mailing list managers which require you to reply to the confirmation email may not work, because if you are using aliases then your reply will not originate from the address that you&apos;re trying to subscribe to the list; but you can still give it a try.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of non-read-only lists (discussion lists) you can&apos;t really get away with aliases. This is because most such lists only accept posts from subscribers and your outgoing address is not going to match your subscribed address (the alias). Even if the list allows you to add other addresses to the &quot;permitted senders&quot; list (I believe that the <a href=\"http://www.courier-mta.org/couriermlm.html\">Courier mailing list manager</a> allows you to do this; others may as well) it&apos;s still not a perfect solution because you end up exposing the underlying address to spammers.</p>\n\n<p>This is unfortunate because it means you&apos;ll almost inevitably have to set up multiple accounts and Mail.app tends to be a pretty heavy abuser of server connections. If you have many accounts set up all on the same server then Mail.app can quickly eat up a huge number of available connections. Using POP instead of IMAP may be of some help but it&apos;s still not ideal. That&apos;s why you may need to elect to have a single account for all the mailing lists to which you intend to make posts, and then set up aliases for all the rest.</p>\n\n<p>There are other possible workarounds to the alias problem. You could do some server-level hackery to change outgoing addresses depending on the recipient, but that won&apos;t help you when you&apos;re trying to mail someone off-list.</p>\n\n<p>So that&apos;s why I&apos;ve gone with the one-account strategy for now. When the spam starts to hit I&apos;ll just have to update all my subscriptions; unfortunately, a pretty painful process.</p>\n</div></div>",

For a few minutes there I was wondering whether I&apos;d discovered the first really nasty piece of Mac OS X spyware; but after a few minutes of investigation it looks like it&apos;s one of my neighbours that has the spyware, and he or she had somehow hacked into my local wireless network (provided via Mac OS X&apos;s Internet connection sharing).</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a000416more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>This started about 20 minutes ago when I noticed (thanks to the <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/rominar/net.html\">Net Monitor</a> icon in my Dock) a steady 80-100KB/s of incoming data despite the fact that I wasn&apos;t actively downloading anything. I checked to make sure that this traffic wasn&apos;t caused by iTunes downloading new podcasts in the background. It wasn&apos;t. My curiosity was piqued. <a href=\"http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/\">Little Snitch</a> hadn&apos;t reported any unauthorized connection attempts. I fired up <a href=\"http://www.interarchy.com/main/\">Interarchy</a> so that I could watch the traffic and get a clue as to what it was.</p>\n\n<p>The alarm bells started to ring when I saw that the traffic was directed to sites of &quot;questionable character&quot;. I picked the first suspicious-looking URL (www.mascosasxsms.com) and visited it in Safari: turned out to be a cheap-and-tacky porn site; ad-laden, filled with pop-ups, and with &quot;dodgy&quot; written across every corner. Other hosts showing up in the traffic included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>sms.putalocurax.com</li>\n<li>chat.chueca.com</li>\n<li>www.sexywebcam.com</li>\n<li>chicas.es</li>\n<li>www.amateursendirecto.com</li>\n<li>www.promocionesweb.com</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Not only where sites like this turning up in the traffic log, they were turning up at an incredible rate, too fast to be generated by a human under normal navigation. &quot;Entrepreneurs&quot; with nothing better to do write spyware that generates false page impressions on sites where ads are placed, and they try to install it (without permission, needless to say) on as many machines as possible so as to maximise their &quot;hard-earned profits&quot;. Spyware would explain the traffic patterns I was seeing.</p>\n\n<p>So I started searching for a spyware process that might be generating this traffic. I checked and double checked the list of open network connections, of open files (<tt>man lsof</tt>) and the process tree in Activity Monitor to try and identify a likely culprit. I quit Safari. I wondered if Mail might be the culprit (something received in an email and exploiting a vulnerability when it passed through the filters or was displayed in the preview pane) but the CPU usage seemed too low.</p>\n\n<p>If this was spyware it was doing a pretty darn good job of hiding itself. I didn&apos;t want to quit any processes because that might cause the network activity to go away before I&apos;d identified the source, but once I had done everything I could think of I turned my attention to the network instead.</p>\n\n<p>I connect to the net via an ADSL2+ modem plugged in directly to my iMac&apos;s ethernet port. I also have Internet connection sharing turned on via AirPort so that I can get on the net with my trusty old G4 PowerBook. The makeshift AirPort network is protected via a password and encrypted via WEP (128-bit, if I recall correctly). Perhaps someone in the area had managed to crack my WEP password and was piggybacking on my connection. Sure enough, as soon as I turned off Internet connection sharing the activity immediately stopped.</p>\n\n<p>The puzzling question is, was this a neighbour whose machine was infected with spyware, or would someone actually want to visit those sites? I doubt it. The traffic log showed that the HTTP requests included a Spanish <tt>Accept-Language</tt> field, indicating that the traffic was probably coming from a real web browser and not some background user-agent process:</p>\n\n<pre>Accept-Language: es-ES,es;q=0.9,en;q=0.8</pre>\n\n<p>But there were also some hits to some harmless hosts like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>download.macromedia.com</li>\n<li>help.opera.com</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Why would a spyware process visit help.opera.com? A couple of different user agent strings were also reported in the log:</p>\n\n<pre>User-Agent: Opera/9.01 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en)\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)</pre>\n\n<p>I don&apos;t really know enough about Windows to know the state of spyware for browsers other than IE. Do Opera and Mozilla host much, if any spyware? Or is this a background user agent pretending to be something it&apos;s not? </p>\n\n<p>There are freely available, legal tools such as <a href=\"http://istumbler.net/\">iStumbler</a> for discovering wireless networks, but I&apos;m not aware of any legal tools which will allow you to perform brute force attacks on encrypted networks. Is there any spyware out there sophisticated enough to hack local wireless networks, or would one of my neighbours have had to break into the network first, only to unwittingly provide net access to the spyware infesting his machine? More questions than answers.</p>\n\n<p>No harm done, but I guess the lessons learned then are the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>turn off AirPort and Internet Connection Sharing when not in use</li>\n<li>change your WEP password regularly</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div></div>",

I observed at first with indignation, but for well over a year now I&apos;ve watched with the same kind of macabre fascination that a bystander finds him or herself unable to turn his head and look away from a traffic accident scene.</p>\n\n<p>And still, after all this time, the case never ceases to surprise me. <a href=\"http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20060913195652112\">Today&apos;s Groklaw article</a> reveals that SCO has spent <strong>eight and a half million dollars</strong> in the last two years on &quot;experts and consultants&quot; for its litigation efforts.  In addition, they have paid an absolutely astounding <strong>twenty-six million dollars</strong> in attorneys&apos; fees.</p>\n\n<p>Think about how much money that is for a second. In this era of big business I think we get desensitized to large sums like that, but if you actually pause for a moment and really reflect on how much money 34.5 million dollars is it&apos;s quite shocking. It&apos;s hard to believe that they&apos;ve been able to spend that much money, doubly confounding because it&apos;s such a worthless, misguided, corrupt undertaking in the first place. I take my hat off to them; I couldn&apos;t have done it. About the only way I can think of to destroy so much cash, so much goodwill, and so much business, is with a truckload of cans of gasoline and an abundant supply of matches.</p>\n\n<p>The sad part is that the real winners in this debacle include the SCO executives who massively increased their wealth by selling off stock when their initial efforts at media manipulation sent the stock price through the roof back in 2003. Other winners include the lawyers who are charging those fees, but they always win, don&apos;t they?

Rather than hold back as I have in the past I think I&apos;ll be upping the minimum requirements for most (if not all) of my apps. I will continue to support the older versions of Mac OS X, but only for bug fixes; most of the new feature work will go into the Leopard-only versions.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, let&apos;s say that a given app is at version 2.2 in its current form. I will probably do a 2.5 release that will be Leopard-only. From that point on all the new feature work will go into 2.5 and up (2.6, 2.7 etc) and only bug fixes will appear in the 2.2 series (2.2.1, 2.2.2 etc). The older series will continue to be available for download alongside the newer versions.</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s quite exciting really... considering that Synergy is still a Jaguar-and-up application, Install is also, and all the others are Panther-and-up.

    "html": "<p>I&apos;ve just spent several hours <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Repository_migration#Caveat\">working around a Subversion problem</a>. I don&apos;t know whether the fault lay with the Subversion internals, is limited to the <tt>svnadmin</tt> tool&apos;s <tt>load</tt> functionality, or is really the fault of the underlying filesystem on Red Hat Linux. Whatever the root cause, it&apos;s cost me a bunch of hours.</p>\n\n<p>The short version: I was trying to migrate a repository from my local Subversion server (on Mac OS X) to a remote Subversion server (on Red Hat Linux). A number of pesky files in old revisions of the repository were preventing the <tt>load</tt> from working, thus derailing the entire process.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000426more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>Google was of no help, only indicating that Subversion has historically had problems with filenames containing certain characters in the names. But there was no indication of whether this had been addressed, what a workaround might be, and whether this was a limitation of only the <tt>svnadmin load</tt> functionality or something deeper down in the Subversion internals or the limitations of the default Red Hat filesystem (ext3, I believe), and most puzzlingly of all how these files managed to get into my repository in the first place if Subversion wasn&apos;t capable of handling them. So the time spent searching Google was essentially wasted time.</p>\n\n<p>So I started trying to get rid of the troublesome paths. This was done by filtering the 90 megabyte repository dump file through <tt>svndumpfilter</tt> to pare out the offending nodes. I&apos;d filter, try the load again, discover another problematic path and repeat the process. Annoyingly, every time the load failed I ended up with a half-written, invalid repository, so I had to painfully delete the new repository, recreate it, reestablish access permissions, set passwords, and tighten filesystem permissions.</p>\n\n<p>In the end I got the new repository up, but the cost was several hours that could have otherwise been spent programming. To add insult to injury I have no idea what the pesky files were doing in the repository in the first place nor why Mac OS X had created them (they were custom folder icons stored inside <tt>.xcode</tt> bundles); and given that they have resource forks the served absolutely no purpose being in the repository at all (where the simple act of adding and committing them turned them into empty, useless files).</p>\n\n<p>This kind of problem is annoying because tools like Subversion are supposed to help you work better, not get in your way and stop you from getting anything else done. But unfortunately it happens all too often with Subversion. It is wonderful software 95% of the time &#x2014; really top notch &#x2014; but the other 5% of the time it throws hurdles down in front of you at knee-level, constantly forcing you to break your rhythm, stoop down, and clear the obstruction.</p>\n\n<p>These little road blocks include things like the problem I faced today, <a href=\"http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=707\">the failure of Subversion to support opaque collections</a>, and <a href=\"http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=2464\">inadequate handling of composed/decomposed Unicode in paths</a>. I want my version control system to work with me, not against me. I don&apos;t really expect it to do anything fancy, I really just want it to store &quot;stuff&quot; in a repository, where &quot;stuff&quot; is anything I want to throw at it.  </p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>In the past my advice, and that of pretty much everyone that matters, has always been &quot;don&apos;t run Mac OS X (log in to the graphical user interface) as the root user&quot;. It&apos;s just a basic security tenet that you should always run with the minimum privileges necessary and only elevate them, temporarily, when necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I&apos;ve always run Mac OS X (logged in to the graphical UI, that is) as an administrator user (but not root) rather than a regular, unprivileged user because root-privileged operations still require a password. That is, nothing should run with root privileges without you first being prompted for authorization.</p>\n\n<p>But after reading <a href=\"http://www.macgeekery.com/tips/security/how_a_malformed_installer_package_can_crack_mac_os_x\">this article</a> my advice has changed. Turns out that there is a security hole in the Mac OS X installer (and yes, it is a security hole in my opinion) that allows an installer to perform tasks as root <em>without prompting for authorization</em>. It&apos;s not the root-powers thing that bothers me, it&apos;s the fact that privilege escalation happens silently, automatically and without prompting.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a000428more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.macgeekery.com/tips/security/how_a_malformed_installer_package_can_crack_mac_os_x\">The article points</a> to an <a href=\"http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=575176\">Apple discussion board topic</a> that brought the issue to the author&apos;s attention. Paraphrasing, the short version is this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>An installer package which asks for <em>administrator privileges</em> (not root privileges), if run by an administrator, can actually get <em>root</em> privileges without the user being prompted for a password. This is because <tt>sudo</tt>, or its low-level API equivalent, <tt>AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges</tt>, is used to run pre- and post-flight scripts in the installer package as root. In other words, anything you can do in a script, you can do as root, and the user will have no idea.</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/SoftwareDistribution4/Concepts/sd_permissions_author.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001769-1038171\">Apple Documentation</a> doesn&apos;t fully confirm the problem, but it does note that installer packages asking for &quot;Administrator&quot; privileges get them, &quot;Authorization not required&quot;, when run as an admin user. What it fails to mention is that the shell-script portions of the installer package will be run with root privileges, not administrator privileges.</p>\n\n<p>Why does this matter? It means you now have to care a lot more about the place where you get installer packages from. In the past, I mistakenly believed that the installer would always prompt me for my password before making any changes to a part of the file system for which I did not have access &#x2014; you always had the chance to think twice, ask why is this package asking for root privileges?, and investigate further or cancel before proceeding &#x2014; but this security hole means that that is not the case. It means that an innocently malformed or maliciously-prepared installer package could literally wipe out your whole system, do anything it wants, write over critical, root-owned files, and all without prompting for a password.</p>\n\n<p>Don&apos;t get me wrong: the basic principle of not running executables or installing packages from untrusted sources has always applied. The difference is in the level of potential damage that can be done without warning. In the past you stood to lose only those files for which you had write privileges; but thanks to this hole you now stand to lose absolutely everything. That is a lot to risk.</p>\n\n<p>So my new advice is now the following: don&apos;t log in to your administrator account, ever. Create a new account with administrator privileges and then demote your existing account to a regular, unprivileged user. It&apos;s the only way to guarantee that when an installer package wants administrator <em>or</em> root privileges that you&apos;ll be prompted for a password.</p>\n\n<p>Given that Apple&apos;s default policy is to grant administrator privileges to the first account created on a machine this is alarming problem and many people could be vulnerable. I hope that they fix the problem very, very soon; the fix should be simple: don&apos;t run installer shell scripts as root when they only request &quot;administrator privileges&quot; and an administrator is logged in, run then as the administrator user instead.</p>\n\n<p>Running from a totally non-privileged account does mean that you&apos;ll have to supply an administrator username and password more often, even for simple operations like copying an application to the <tt>/Applications/</tt> folder, and you won&apos;t be able to use <tt>sudo</tt> directly from the shell anymore (you&apos;ll first have to <tt>su</tt> to an administrator account, then use <tt>sudo</tt> from there), but given the stakes involved it seems that it&apos;s a price that you have no choice but to pay.</p>\n\n<h4>Update: 29 November</h4>\n\n<p>Looks like Apple has no <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304829\">addressed this issue</a> in a security update:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Admin users are normally required to authenticate before executing commands with system privileges. However, the Installer allows system privileges to be used by Admin users when installing certain packages without requiring authentication. This update addresses the issue by requiring authentication before installing software with system privileges.</blockquote>\n\n<p>In light of this change I&apos;ve added myself to the <tt>/etc/sudoers</tt> file, although I am continuing to run Mac OS X from an otherwise unprivileged account. This means I can do stuff like <tt>sudo make install</tt> (still requiring a password) rather than have to <tt>su</tt> to an administrator account first.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

Works for me, at least.</p>\n\n<p>See also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://macdevlog.com/yellow-for-your-eyes.html\">&quot;Proclamation for the benefit of your light sensing organs&quot;</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<div id=\"a000432more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p><a href=\"http://www.spamhaus.org/\">Spamhaus</a> is an anti-spam DNS-based blacklisting service. Some people in business advise against using such blacklists on the grounds that they could potentially block legitimate email and thus harm the business.</p>\n\n<p>I don&apos;t agree for three reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Spam is such a massive problem nowadays that not just private individuals, but businesses also have to take steps to protect themselves</li>\n<li>Spamhaus is remarkably accurate (see below) and effective</li>\n<li>It&apos;s possible to reject email based on a DNS-based blacklist and include alternative contact information in the bounce message, meaning that people will always have a means of getting in touch regardless of the filter</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div id=\"a000433more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>In the past 24 hours, for example, Spamhaus has shielded me from 479 connection attempts from known spammer IP addresses. That&apos;s several hundred messages that would otherwise have passed on to the next line of defense (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Blocking_non-local_senders_for_local-only_recipients\">blocking non-local senders for local-only recipients</a>, 53 additional messages stopped in the last 24 hours), and the next (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Combatting_spam\">SpamAssassin</a>).</p>\n\n<p>So it is effective. But is it accurate? Are there any false positives? A quick look at the logs indicates that a 100% accuracy rate is highly probable. Look at the rejected IP addresses below; many are forged, about a third of them don&apos;t even have reverse IP lookups, and the vast majority obviously correspond to home dialup or broadband end users, most likely compromised Windows machines turned into mail-spewing zombies for the benefit of the greedy spammers.</p>\n\n<p>So if it blocks that much spam with such a high accuracy and efficacy rate, and if you can provide an alternative means of contact in the bounce message anyway, the question isn&apos;t why would you use Spamhaus but why wouldn&apos;t you?</p>\n\n<pre><code>[121.127.167.153]\n[124.136.42.89]\n[124.28.25.53]\n[125.176.232.97]\n[125.212.117.194]\n[125.212.87.20]\n[193.231.139.172]\n[196.202.25.32]\n[196.202.35.140]\n[200.164.17.148]\n[200.251.244.139]\n[200.28.39.25]\n[200.6.171.83]\n[200.60.205.112]\n[200.91.72.106]\n[201.218.33.174]\n[201.230.254.186]\n[201.250.128.155]\n[201.37.200.38]\n[201.44.146.155]\n[201.65.109.20]\n[201.65.228.250]\n[202.155.128.239]\n[202.53.8.229]\n[202.53.9.199]\n[202.71.140.103]\n[202.83.58.142]\n[202.91.14.139]\n[203.63.158.216]\n[203.81.234.56]\n[203.84.185.114]\n[206.128.209.12]\n[207.250.71.46]\n[208.99.220.134]\n[209.194.72.195]\n[210.18.137.193]\n[210.182.103.235]\n[210.222.22.82]\n[210.4.30.218]\n[211.117.121.205]\n[211.187.207.78]\n[211.195.55.161]\n[211.213.109.136]\n[211.226.225.125]\n[212.175.12.179]\n[218.232.172.37]\n[218.37.247.50]\n[218.54.9.212]\n[218.62.36.11]\n[218.71.141.254]\n[218.75.178.201]\n[218.8.124.37]\n[218.93.120.170]\n[218.95.202.79]\n[219.129.251.162]\n[219.148.143.50]\n[219.151.42.26]\n[219.234.241.217]\n[220.195.236.91]\n[220.81.14.207]\n[220.82.226.202]\n[220.92.159.121]\n[221.139.134.8]\n[221.163.139.99]\n[221.165.193.67]\n[221.165.41.242]\n[221.208.9.184]\n[222.117.71.21]\n[222.136.71.36]\n[222.171.131.58]\n[222.210.42.38]\n[222.253.137.57]\n[222.253.18.53]\n[222.253.94.186]\n[222.40.127.119]\n[24.138.219.23]\n[58.120.6.99]\n[58.142.201.244]\n[58.239.81.45]\n[58.68.73.86]\n[59.5.229.182]\n[59.8.97.74]\n[59.93.129.205]\n[59.93.9.242]\n[59.94.104.31]\n[59.94.40.23]\n[60.195.102.196]\n[60.51.68.7]\n[60.63.254.51]\n[61.133.210.194]\n[61.141.175.187]\n[61.153.236.234]\n[61.177.74.58]\n[61.47.68.200]\n[61.83.104.29]\n[65.103.154.217]\n[68.40.223.232]\n[70.103.190.81]\n[70.151.159.194]\n[71.224.61.127]\n[71.31.210.95]\n[80.50.86.158]\n[80.51.191.54]\n[80.51.83.105]\n[80.65.66.36]\n[81.52.163.11]\n[81.84.180.19]\n[82.160.241.135]\n[84.36.3.81]\n[84.90.85.53]\n[85.101.11.213]\n[85.101.14.73]\n[85.101.61.86]\n[85.103.231.115]\n[86.125.213.146]\n[87.245.149.251]\n[88.224.148.154]\n[88.240.186.87]\n[89.136.118.132]\n113-11-116.adsl.cust.tie.cl

    "html": "<p>Sometimes you make bad decisions that later come back to bite you. About three years ago when I started work on <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> I was still relatively new to <a href=\"http://subversion.tigris.org/\">Subversion</a>. So, rather than creating a new repository I decided to store the Synergy Advance code within a subdirectory of the <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">Synergy</a> repository.</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve been living with the uncomfortable consequences of that decision ever since. The two codebases are completely separate but because they live in the same repository it means that the <tt>tags</tt> and <tt>branches</tt> subdirectories are cluttered with entries for two projects instead of one. Worse still, the <tt>trunk</tt> itself is shared by two separate projects and sometimes, through lack of discipline or by mistake, commits (changesets) that should really be split up into two separate actions (one for each project) end up getting shoved into the repository in one go.</p>\n\n<p>It also means that the relative paths in the Synergy Advance project look different to the same paths in Synergy (and just about every other project I have). For example, the relative path to the build directory is <tt>../../build</tt> for Synergy but <tt>../../../build</tt> for Synergy Advance. That lack of consistency makes sharing components with other project difficult.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000434more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>So finally, yesterday, after putting it off and simply &quot;living with it&quot; for years, I finally extracted Synergy Advance into a repository of its own and it now lives as a peer alongside Synergy, WOBase, WOBezel, WOCommon, WODebug, WOHotKey, WOTest and every other project in my portfolio, all with the same relative path to a shared built products folder.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to finally bite the bullet because there&apos;s a lot of other breakage at the moment so I may as well deal with it in one fell swoop, seeing as the project is not in a buildable state right now anyway. The major change I&apos;m dealing with is the result of another &quot;correction&quot; that I made recently; <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Frameworks:_pros_and_cons\">the decision</a> to start putting share code in WOCommon where appropriate rather than in the existing shared frameworks. This means that code is getting migrated out of the frameworks with varying degrees of violence, sometimes merely forked and copied over, and other times ripped out directly.  New code can start using WOCommon without any problems, but the frameworks themselves need modifications as do the applications that use them in order to build correctly.</p>\n\n<p>So along with the extraction into a separate repository, last night I started modifying code in Synergy Advance to start making use of stuff in WOCommon. Nothing too aggressive just yet, but in general making use of superior functionality where it is available. In the long run WOBase will all but disappear (in fact, I think it&apos;s almost certain that it will disappear) and the result will be a better codebase, more compact, more efficient, faster to load, and less memory-hungry.</p>\n\n<p>The short-term task, however, is to fix all the relative links in the relocated project file (given that it&apos;s moved up one level in the file system hierarchy), double check the build settings for all targets in the Synergy Advance project (at the time of writing, 23 of them!) to make sure that they&apos;ll still all correct, and revise all the shell scripts to make sure they&apos;ll continue to work as intended. Then I&apos;ll turn my attention to the frameworks, particularly WODebug and WOBase (the ones which have seen the most radical changes in the move to WOCommon) and get them back into a buildable, functional state again.</p>\n\n<p>Of course it&apos;s easy to see in hindsight that I should have done things this way all along, but that&apos;s the nature of things. Even when you employ &quot;best practice&quot; (using a Subversion repository, putting reusable code in frameworks) you still sometimes learn that there are even better ways of doing things (using Subversion externals and so forth). And looking at my development files over the last few years there&apos;s no doubt that they&apos;ve gotten better; a shared build location, centralized configuration via Xcode configuration files (<tt>xcconfig</tt>), the development of general-purpose, &quot;write once, use everywhere&quot; tools for the build chain (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/buildtools/\">buildtools</a>), <a href=\"http://strings.wincent.com/\">better localization practices</a>, <a href=\"http://test.wincent.com/\">unit testing</a>, and better use of Subversion (using externals, for example, and making better use of branches and tags).</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;m optimistic that things really are coming close to their final shape &#x2014; well, as final as these things can ever get &#x2014; and that my work practices five years from now won&apos;t look all that much different from what they look like today; not because I&apos;m lazy or fear change (I don&apos;t) but because I&apos;m getting close to knocking my development practices into the best shape that they can be.</p>\n</div></div>",

You can get to it from almost every page on this website by clicking the &quot;News&quot; button in the navigation bar that spans to the top of most pages.  As a shortcut, you can also get there via automatic redirection when you visit <a href=\"http://wincent.org/\">wincent.org</a>, a historical wink to the fact that before entering the software business I edited a popular news, rumors and commentary weblog at wincent.org.</p>\n\n<p>An <a href=\"feed://wincent.com/a/news/atom.xml\">XML feed</a> of the product and site news weblog is also available.</p>\n\n<h4>Mailing lists</h4>\n\n<p>An alternative means of finding out about new product releases and updates is to subscribe to one of the opt-in mailing lists. The purpose and functioning of the lists are described <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/lists/\">on this page</a> and you can subscribe or browse the archives by visiting <a href=\"http://lists.wincent.com/\">http://lists.wincent.com/</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Wincent Colaiuta&apos;s personal weblog</h4>\n\n<p>I also maintain a personal weblog at <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/\">http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/</a> (shortcut: <a href=\"http://colaiuta.net/\">colaiuta.net</a>; <a href=\"feed://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/atom.xml\">XML feed</a>). The vast majority of posts are about my development work and provide a sneak peak at the problems I am working on and the progress that I am making behind the scenes.</p>\n\n<h4>Mini-log</h4>\n\n<p>In a sidebar on the left-hand side of <a href=\"http://colaiuta.net/\">my personal weblog</a> you can find the &quot;Mini-log&quot;. This is where I post quick comments or links that are too short to warrant a full entry on my weblog. A separate feed for the Mini-log is <a href=\"feed://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/mini-log/atom.xml\">available here</a>, and the archives can be found <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/mini-log/archives/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Git log (formerly the Subversion log)</h4>\n\n<p>For an extremely low-level look at the development work I&apos;m doing you can check out my &quot;Git log&quot; (formerly called the &quot;Subversion log&quot;). This appears in the sidebar of <a href=\"http://colaiuta.net/\">my personal weblog</a>, below the &quot;Mini-log&quot;. The Git log shows the commit log messages that accompany every finalized set of changes to the code bases for my products. The general pattern is to work on a discrete set of changes and then &quot;commit&quot; them to the repository when they reach some sort of important milestone; the &quot;milestone&quot; may be something as simple as the elimination of a particular compiler warning during the build or the addition of a new file, and they can be as significant as implementing a big new feature or importing an entirely new product into the repository. For more information see this <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion\">brief outline of Subversion</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A feed is <a href=\"feed://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/atom.xml\">available</a> of the Git log, as are <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/\">archives</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Git log was <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Setting_up_a_Subversion_RSS_feed\">set up</a> in late September 2006, so the archives start from that date. The name change from &quot;Git log&quot; to &quot;Subversion log&quot; took place in mid-July 2007, and there are quite a few articles on Git in my weblog <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/07/\">archives for that month</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>Gitweb</h4>\n\n<p>Along with the move from Subversion to Git we get a nice web-based interface for browsing the public source code repositories which correspond to the open source projects used in my development. The Gitweb interface can be found at <a href=\"http://git.wincent.com/\">git.wincent.com</a> and provides multiple ways of viewing the repository and its history, including RSS feeds.</p>\n\n<h4>Nightly builds</h4>\n\n<p>In the right-hand column of my <a href=\"http://colaiuta.net/\">weblog</a> you&apos;ll see a section labelled &quot;Nightlog&quot;. This is a collection of links to the latest automated nightly builds that have been uploaded to the server. If you click on those links you&apos;ll see a disclaimer like this one:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Nightly builds are generated once per day by an automated system; they are not official releases and they receive no human testing prior to being uploaded. They are provided with no warranty of any kind; use them at your own risk.</blockquote>\n\n<p>An <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/nightlog/atom.xml\">RSS feed</a> as well as <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/nightlog/archives/\">archives</a> are available for the Nightlog.</p>\n\n<p>For background information see <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/03/planned_changes.php\">this article</a> where I talk about introducing the nightly builds and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/03/nightly_builds.php\">this follow-up</a> written after the build system went live in March 2007.</p>\n\n<h4>Bugs and feature requests database</h4>\n\n<p>If you&apos;re interested in keeping up to date with progress towards a specific bug fix or feature implementation you can add yourself as a &quot;CC&quot; to the corresponding issue in the bugs and feature requests database (<a href=\"http://bugs.wincent.com/\">http://bugs.wincent.com/</a>). You can then tailor your preferences to control how and when you&apos;ll be notified when changes are made to the issue.</p>\n\n<p>The database also features a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/bugs/query.cgi\">powerful query interface</a>. For example, I made <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/bugs/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&amp;short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&amp;short_desc=&amp;long_desc_type=allwordssubstr&amp;long_desc=&amp;bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&amp;bug_file_loc=&amp;keywords_type=allwords&amp;keywords=&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;bug_status=RESOLVED&amp;bug_status=VERIFIED&amp;bug_status=CLOSED&amp;emailassigned_to1=1&amp;emailtype1=substring&amp;email1=&amp;emailassigned_to2=1&amp;emailreporter2=1&amp;emailcc2=1&amp;emailtype2=substring&amp;email2=&amp;bugidtype=include&amp;bug_id=&amp;votes=&amp;chfieldfrom=-7d&amp;chfieldto=Now&amp;chfield=%5BBug+creation%5D&amp;chfield=alias&amp;chfield=assigned_to&amp;chfield=bug_file_loc&amp;chfield=bug_severity&amp;chfield=bug_status&amp;chfield=cclist_accessible&amp;chfield=component&amp;chfield=deadline&amp;chfield=everconfirmed&amp;chfield=keywords&amp;chfield=op_sys&amp;chfield=priority&amp;chfield=product&amp;chfield=qa_contact&amp;chfield=rep_platform&amp;chfield=reporter&amp;chfield=reporter_accessible&amp;chfield=resolution&amp;chfield=short_desc&amp;chfield=status_whiteboard&amp;chfield=target_milestone&amp;chfield=version&amp;chfield=votes&amp;chfieldvalue=&amp;cmdtype=doit&amp;order=Reuse+same+sort+as+last+time&amp;field0-0-0=noop&amp;type0-0-0=noop&amp;value0-0-0=\">this query</a> by entering &quot;-7d&quot; in one of the relative date fields; it shows all of the issues which have changed in some way over the last seven days.</p>\n\n<h4>Forums</h4>\n\n<p>Although I try to post most of the information about my progress to my <a href=\"http://colaiuta.net/\">personal weblog</a>, questions occasionally crop up in the forums (<a href=\"http://forums.wincent.com/\">http://forums.wincent.com/</a>) which may be of interest. Once you have an account for the forums you can &quot;subscribe&quot; to them and be notified once per day (if there are new posts).</p>\n\n<h4>Knowledge base</h4>\n\n<p>I often make notes in the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/\">knowledge base</a> about things I am working on and technical problems I am solving.</p>\n\n<p>The knowledge base is wiki-based and features a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Special:Recentchanges\">&quot;Recent changes&quot;</a> page and a corresponding <a href=\"feed://wincent.com/a/kb/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges&amp;feed=atom\">XML feed</a> that you can use to monitor activity.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "file": "content/blog/open-vs-closed-secrecy-competition-and-business",
    "html": "<p>Lately I&apos;ve been thinking about a couple of binary oppositions: open source versus proprietary, and more generally, openness versus secrecy. Starting from the basic premise that if you&apos;re selling software you&apos;re doing so in the hope of making some money (a living, even!), what then is the most likely course to be successful? Should you side with openness or with secrecy, with competitiveness or co-operation?</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a000481more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>The basic goal</h4>\n\n<p>So the basic goal is to make money, but we probably need to explore that idea a little bit before going on.</p>\n\n<p>There are number of ways to make money; I&apos;m not just talking about <em>things you do</em> here but rather the &quot;ways&quot; you do them, in the more ideological sense. The desire to make money is the engine of capitalism; in general it works wonderfully but sometimes it has some unpleasant manifestations. You can try to make money ethically, or you can throw your moral code out the window (as many corporations do) and adopt a cut throat &quot;win at all costs&quot; sort of attitude. Many businesses walk a particularly nasty gray zone in which they do all they can to maintain an <em>appearance</em> of ethicality but their surface decency is really only a marketing ploy, a mask for the underlying ideology of profit at any cost.</p>\n\n<p>Bearing this in mind, let&apos;s move on...</p>\n\n<h4>Open source vs closed source</h4>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve written on previous occasions that I don&apos;t really think that open source works for the small vendor. Donation rates in my own experience have always been worse than 1 donation per 1,000 downloads, and the truth is that the rate is probably closer to 1 donation per <em>10,000</em> downloads. You may chose to release some products as open source as a marketing exercise, to bring more people to your site, to return something to the community, or simply because you think it&apos;s the right thing to do, but you&apos;re extremely unlikely to make a living off of open source software as a small vendor.</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s not so much that open source itself is the problem; it&apos;s the donation model which is broken. Basically, if donations are optional then you&apos;ll get very few donations. Many developers would love to make their products &quot;donationware&quot; &#x2014; imagine the &quot;feelgood&quot; effect of making a living while sharing with your community &#x2014; but they can&apos;t because of the poor donation rates; if they want to make a living from their software they&apos;re forced to charge for it and that generally also means implementing some kind of license code scheme (experience has also shown that &quot;I&apos;ve paid&quot; checkboxes are just as unsuccessful as donation-based schemes).</p>\n\n<p>This straight away sharpens the dichotomy between open source and closed source. Developers can&apos;t really choose &quot;open or closed&quot; and choose &quot;donations or paid&quot; independently. If you choose &quot;paid&quot; then you&apos;re basically forced to choose &quot;closed&quot; as well. If you choose &quot;donations&quot; you may as well choose &quot;open&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>So why does choosing &quot;paid&quot; force you to choose &quot;closed&quot; as well? Three main reasons spring to mind:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Most license code schemes rely on at least some degree of &quot;security through obscurity&quot;, forcing you to close your source.</li>\n<li>The competition at the heart of capitalism tends to penalize those who share their secrets. To clarify, <em>you</em> might be an ethical capitalist who believes in competition through innovation, developing original ideas, and hard work; but there will always be others who believe only in profit and will have no qualms about taking your source code and selling it as their own.</li>\n<li>Even in an ideal world where competition was only ever respectful and ethical, open sourcing almost invariably means using a free software license, and that means that along with the source code you grant the right to produce free derivatives; that freedom effectively guarantees the emergence of a free version of you product, thus eliminating any motivation that customers might have had to purchase it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Openness versus secrecy</h4>\n\n<p>So it seems clear that at least some of your portfolio has to be closed source, but does that necessarily mean that you have to be closed and secret in every respect?</p>\n\n<p>Imagine that you find out about a really useful command line trick that will help you out with your development. Do you make it public, benefitting the people who visit your website? Or do you keep it secret, knowing that the information could be useful to your competitors and you want to do everything in your power to maintain a competitive advantage?</p>\n\n<p>My advice is the following: share it; you&apos;ll sleep much better at night, have lower blood pressure, feel less stressed, and you&apos;ll probably come out in front in the long run anyway as your site becomes more useful, turns up higher in Google search result listings, and more people visit your site and learn about your products.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

    "file": "content/blog/product-activation-improvements",
    "html": "<p>I&apos;ve spent the day making improvements to my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/activation/\">product activation</a> systems and I am fairly pleased with the results. These changes should make the product activation experience (which is already pretty good) even better for customers (when talking about copy protection there are two kinds of improvements you can make: those which make life easier for your customers and those which make life harder for pirates; the changes I&apos;ve made today belong to the former class).</p>\n\n<p>I started thinking about this earlier this month when a <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> user wrote in asking:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Is there no way to &quot;deactivate&quot; authentication on a system you&apos;re departing?</blockquote>\n\n<div id=\"a000489more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>The user in question works in the press and changes machines frequently. My response at the time was this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Knowing that there would be cases like this, when I designed the system I included the ability to reset or increase activation limits. For example, if someone needed to do 100 legitimate reinstalls I could assign a very high limit to their license. I had to rule out the activate-and-deactivate pattern and stick with activate-only for the reasons described further down.<br>\n<br>\nThe limits (in the case of a single-user license like yours, five installs) have proven to be a good compromise. In the year and a half since Synergy Advance was first released the vast majority have only activated once, and more than 99% of users haven&apos;t hit the limit. The handful of users who have hit the limit have contacted me and I&apos;ve reset their limits. In a case like yours where you&apos;ve not only hit the limit but you also know that you&apos;re likely to hit it again, I can set a higher-than-usual limit so that you won&apos;t be bothered by it.<br>\n<br>\nIt&apos;s true that the solution is not perfect but it has proven to be a successful compromise; unlike <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">Synergy</a> which has always been very heavily pirated I&apos;ve yet to see any Synergy Advance license code leaks. Basically it forces attackers to use cracking (harder) rather than mere license sharing (easier), and it seems to work very well.</blockquote>\n\n<p>With specific reference to the &quot;deauthorization&quot; idea I wrote this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>I&apos;ve thought a little about that possibility but it seems that it would weaken the security of the system too much. Evidently it can be done; a good example is the way Apple permits you to authorize and deauthorize computers for playback of music purchased on the iTMS. I&apos;d like to know how they do it, but I can&apos;t think of a way to do this securely.<br>\n<br>\nBasically, in Synergy Advance &quot;de-activating&quot; amounts to deleting the activation certificate stored in your preferences folder. Synergy Advance would then have to inform the server that it&apos;s been deactivated on that machine. But what&apos;s to stop an attacker from keeping a copy of the certificate, performing the &quot;de-activation&quot;, and then re-installing the certificate manually, thus circumventing the system?<br>\n<br>\nSynergy Advance relies on strong cryptography for security and puts the activation certificate in plain sight. If I were to try hiding it somewhere (whether in a file on the disk or in the keychain) to prevent the attacker from pulling the trick described above, then it would be relying on security-through-obscurity, which would defeat the entire purpose of the system (to rely on cryptography instead of obscurity).<br>\n<br>\nI don&apos;t know how Apple does it with iTunes, but the in-plain-view design of Synergy Advance makes this pretty much impossible. Any &quot;de-activation&quot; scheme would effectively amount to the server trusting the client when it says, &quot;I deleted the certificate, I really did, I swear!&quot;, and that goes against sound practice. (As a side note, one of the benefits of the in-plain-view design is that users can easily backup their activation certificates, which is a good thing.)<br>\n<br>\nAs far as workarounds go there seem to be two, phoning home and obscurity, and neither of them are acceptable:<br>\n<br>\n1. Seeing as users hate apps which &quot;phone home&quot; the current system is designed to connect to the wincent.com server (with the user&apos;s permission) once and only once. Once the activation certificate is written to the disk it doesn&apos;t connect to the server ever again. This design decision means that I can&apos;t do a &quot;re-check the activation with the server on every single run&quot; approach, which would mean that certificates wouldn&apos;t need to be written to disk and would solve the server-client trust problem. But you can&apos;t require users to be on the Internet all the time so it&apos;s simply not an option; maybe in a decade it will be but I don&apos;t think the market is ready for it right now.<br>\n<br>\n2. I have thought about approaches to the server-client trust problem using strong cryptography (digitally signed executable to detect tampering, public key challenge-response sequences etc) and none of them seem to be able to address the underlying problem: that the certificate is in the open and can therefore be backed up, and trying to hide it puts us back in the security-through-obscurity camp again.<br>\n<br>\nBut the system is not set in stone, so as time goes by I will raise the activation limits if necessary across the board, and if I can identify ways to make re-activations less frequent then I&apos;ll do that. Likewise if I can ever come up with a secure method for implementing a &quot;de-activation&quot; scheme then I&apos;ll be happy to do it.</blockquote>\n\n<h4>An alternative solution</h4>\n\n<p>The goal of the activation system to make life easy for honest customers and harder for pirates. It is not the intention of the system to stop license infringement on a small scale (&quot;user installs software on laptop and desktop machine even though he/she only has a license for a single machine&quot;); it&apos;s intended to limit the damage done by mass piracy (&quot;stolen serial number leaks onto net and is distributed to tens of thousands&quot;).</p>\n\n<p>So in the wee small hours of the morning before going to bed last night it occurred to me that one way to improve the system would be to grant users additional activations over time. Granting one additional activation per year would be very helpful to customers who upgrade to new machines every year or two, and would do nothing to lessen the efficacy of the system against its stated target (mass piracy). Additionally, this improvement makes good business sense because it should reduce the number of activation-related support inquiries over the long term (over the next 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 years...), thus freeing up more resources for development.</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;m still very interested in the question of &quot;deauthorization&quot;, but it really is more of an intellectual curiosity than any intention to actually divert development resources to exploring the question. I know that users would prefer me to work on features so that&apos;s what I&apos;m focussing on.</p>\n\n<h4>The implementation</h4>\n\n<p>With some disdain I realized that my product activation database didn&apos;t have a &quot;created&quot; date/time field in the licenses table, which meant that I couldn&apos;t write database queries like &quot;select all licenses purchased a year ago&quot;. A shocking omission, I know. Nowadays I include &quot;created&quot; and &quot;updated&quot; fields in my databases even if I don&apos;t anticipate ever needing them, but due to my lack of foresight my licenses table only had an &quot;updated&quot; field, not a &quot;created&quot; one.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully the necessary modifications turned out to be relatively clean and easy. A single <tt>ALTER TABLE</tt> statement was all that was needed to add the appropriate column in the database, and then thanks to the modular design of the code and the fact that all database access is channelled through a single database abstraction wrapper, there was only one place in the code base that needed to be changed to insert the creation date into the table whenever a new license is issued.</p>\n\n<p>I was then able to go through the database and insert appropriate creation dates (because most of the licenses were accompanied by PayPal Instant Payment Notifications or Kagi KRPS posts and so the purchase date information was available to me), again with a single SQL statement for each one (although I admit that these were fairly ghastly looking). I adjusted the few manually-generated licenses by hand. I prepared a cron script that will be run once per day and update the database, basically awarding users an additional activation per year. Finally, I went all the way back to Day 1 and made the adjustments for licenses purchased more than one year ago so that they would receive the same benefits as if this system had been in place all along.</p>\n\n<p>A little bit more detail about the result can be seen under the heading, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/activation/#limits\">&quot;How many activations may I perform?&quot;</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/activation/\">product activation</a> page. Here is an excerpt, although you should make a point of visiting <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/activation/#limits\">the page in question</a> to be certain that you&apos;re reading the most up-to-date information possible:</p>\n\n<blockquote>At the time of writing (September 2006) the number of activations that may be performed for a single-user license is five. A single-user license permits you to install and run the software on a single machine, but the activation limit is set to five activations, not one, to allow for scenarios such as switching to a new machine, replacing your hard drive, or performing a full system re-install. This is because the spirit of the activation system is to target mass piracy, not penalize honest, paying customers.<br>\n<br>\nThe number of activations permitted may be adjusted in the future based on experience and feedback from customers. Since the release of Synergy Advance in May 2005, a five-activation limit has proved to be appropriate in the vast majority of cases. An automatic system is in place that performs a yearly revision of each license and that grants users an additional activation per license, per user, per year; this should fit in nicely with the typical pattern in which users upgrade to new machines once every year or two. The additional activation(s) are applied to any license that is in good standing (activation limit not exceeded) and which has been activated at some point in the previous 12 months.<br>\n<br>\nIf you exceed the activation limit, you may open a support ticket and request that your limit be reset.</blockquote>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Two kernel panics while trying to boot from a just-installed copy of Mac OS X. I won&apos;t bother telling you what version of the OS it was...</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000530more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>Panic #1</h4>\n\n<p>Installed with all the defaults, except added the X11 package and deselected the printer drivers package. On rebooting got a kernel panic while still looking at the spinning progress indicator. Rebooted from the OS DVD and ran Disk First Aid, just to be safe.</p>\n\n<h4>Panic #2</h4>\n\n<p>Tried booting from the new install again and got another panic at the same point. Again rebooted from the DVD and ran Disk First aid, but this time picked up a problem:</p>\n\n<pre>Checking Catalog file.\nIncorrect block count for file .store.db\n(It should be 0 instead of 21)</pre>\n\n<p>Now, these panics would be annoying in the best of cases because of the threat they pose to the integrity of your precious data; that&apos;s why I installed the OS on a separate partition on an external FireWire drive. But this second panic was doubly-annoying because the damaged file system wasn&apos;t on the external (test) drive; it was on my internal drive. What was the OS doing touching that drive and corrupting it? And what good is journalling? Almost none, apparently.</p>\n\n<p>So let&apos;s tally this up: nearly two hours of time wasted rebooting, installing the OS, rebooting, panicking, rebooting, verifying, rebooting, panicking, verifying and repairing and finally rebooting again (back to my old install); and after all that I&apos;ve achieved nothing except risking my data and littering a partition with unusable files.</p>\n\n<p>Why the crash? Why nothing written to <tt>/Library/Logs/panic.log</tt>? Doesn&apos;t the OS support booting off an external FireWire enclosure? Do you expect me to install this thing on my internal drive on my production machine? Are you nuts?</p>\n\n<h4>Involuntary reboot stats to date</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Operating system version:</strong> go figure</li>\n<li><strong>Kernel panics:</strong> 4</li>\n<li><strong>Hard resets:</strong> 0</li>\n<li><strong>Total failures:</strong> 4</li>\n<li><strong>Average time between failures:</strong> 32 days</li>\n<li><strong>Uptime at moment of failure(s):</strong> Less than one minute</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Leopard update</h4>\n\n<p>On a <em>completely</em> unrelated note, looks like my plans for starting some Leopard-specific development work have been postponed indefinitely. You see, to do that kind of work I&apos;d need a machine with a bootable Leopard install on it... I wonder if Apple will provide ADC Select members with a later version of Leopard prior to it being released, or whether we&apos;re stuck with the WWDC preview; I sure hope so, and I hope they get it to us with enough time to enable us to actually do something useful with it.</p>\n\n<p>I guess I could try installing the WWDC preview on my 3-year-old laptop. Maybe that would work.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "file": "content/blog/object-oriented-templating",
    "html": "<p>I&apos;m in the process of falling in love with object-oriented templating, and specifically with the <a href=\"http://cheetahtemplate.org/\">Cheetah</a> Python-powered templating engine.</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve always been a big fan of code re-use. This site, for example, has a number of re-usable elements that appear on a large number of pages (the navigation bar up the top, the &quot;bread crumbs&quot;, the side boxes); these elements appear only once on the disk and are included in multiple pages. Update the included element once and all the pages that use it automatically reflect the change. The separation of content (HTML) and layout/style information (CSS) is another manifestation of the re-use philosophy; change the CSS in one place and all pages which include the style sheet will benefit from the change.</p>\n\n<p>But I wanted more than just re-use of elements. I wanted a truly object-oriented templating system. This would allow me to not only re-use elements but to modify them on the fly, omit them, augment them, filter them, warp them... The benefits of this pattern will be immediately evident to any programmer who&apos;s worked with an object-oriented programming language (seems to be a point that <a href=\"http://jogin.com/weblog/archives/2004/03/19/template_systems\">this guy just doesn&apos;t get</a>).</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000607more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>I originally looked for an object-oriented templating system in <a href=\"http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\">Ruby</a>, my current favorite scripting language, but couldn&apos;t find anything; anything useful was buried under an avalanche of references to <a href=\"http://www.rubyonrails.org/\">Ruby on Rails</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/\">ERB</a>, the templating system used by Rails. But ERB isn&apos;t what I&apos;m looking for, unless I misunderstand it: ERB is basically a way of embedding Ruby in HTML just like you would with PHP; it allows you to embed an object-oriented langauge (Ruby) into your templates but it doesn&apos;t provide you with a way of making the templates themselves into an object-oriented hierarchy.</p>\n\n<p>So Cheetah looked like the answer, and indeed it looked so good that I&apos;m prepared to learn <a href=\"http://www.python.org/\">Python</a> in order to be able to use it (although you don&apos;t need to know any Python at all to do the most basic stuff). I later learned about <a href=\"http://amrita.sourceforge.jp/\">Amrita</a> (written in Ruby) but it doesn&apos;t seem to fit the bill like Cheetah does (no template inheritance, overloads the <tt>id</tt> attribute which already has meaning in HTML).</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://jogin.com/weblog/archives/2004/03/19/template_systems\">the article I linked to above</a>,&#xA0;Tomas Jogin describes his search for a template system that would allow him to purge his templates of <em>all</em> logic. I think his argument is misguided for a number of reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It&apos;s good to separate presentation from what&apos;s known as &quot;business logic&quot;, but Jogin wants to separate <em>presentation</em> logic from the presentation as well. Yes, models should be separate from views, controllers should mediate between them, and you shouldn&apos;t mish-mash your models, views and controllers wihout very good reason; but that doesn&apos;t mean that your presentation has to be totally unsullied by presentation logic.</li>\n<li>Jogin argues that designers working with HTML should not be expected to know how to handle the &quot;logic&quot; side of things; yet somehow he expects them to learn an arcane attribute syntax which they must use in the template to map aspects of the model to the presentation of the model. I would argue that anyone who knows how to produce layouts using raw HTML is also capable of working with an extremely simple <tt>for</tt> loop syntax.</li>\n<li>Separating presentation logic from the rest of the presentation specification adds unnecessary complexity to the system, requring more code and making it harder to maintain.</li>\n<li>Embedding the model-to-presentation mapping information in HTML attributes effectively hides them when working in a WYSIWYG editor. It&apos;s better for a designer to see a clear <tt>#if</tt>/<tt>#else</tt>/<tt>#endif</tt> conditional out in the open.</li>\n<li>And most importantly of all, his line of argument leads him to completely overlook the single most important benefit of template engines like Cheetah: that their object-oriented nature allows them to deliver a degree of code re-use that convential templating languages (like PHP itself) can never achieve.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It&apos;s too late for this website for me to benefit from Cheetah; but in a future revision I will most definitely start using object-oriented templates. But one area where I can start using Cheetah immediately is in the preparation of the in-application help documentation that I ship with my products. I&apos;m currently getting up to speed on this right now and will be replacing the PHP-based tools that currently form part of the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/buildtools/\">Wincent Build Tools</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But I can also see Cheetah as being of great help in my programming too. As an example, <a href=\"http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2005/01/13/cheetah.html\">this article</a> shows how Cheetah is not necessarily limited to producing HTML documents. I can imagine scenarios in which I use Cheetah templates to churn out uniform chunks of code (like indexed accessor methods). The idea for this was inspired by <a href=\"http://rentzsch.com/code/mogenerator\">this post</a> where Jonathan &apos;Wolf&apos; Rentzsch describes a tool for taking the busy work out of generating managed object subclasses. In short, you divide your code into two files: the human-maintained part (the main class) and a machine-generated part (in this case, a Cheetah-template-driven category on the main class). The human-maintained part contains all the custom code and the machine-generated part contains invariant, repetitive code that will always be written the same way and can therefore be done by a dumb machine. The machine-generated part can be updated (re-generated) at will without overwriting the human-maintained part.</p>\n\n<p>So I&apos;m off to continue getting together a bunch of Cheetah-related tools for me build chain (you can easily drive all this stuff <a href=\"http://cheetahtemplate.org/docs/users_guide_html_multipage/tips.Makefile.html\">using makefiles</a>, how cool is that?).</p>\n</div></div>",

    "file": "content/blog/kagi-a-recommendation-for-developers",
    "html": "<p>I offer two <a href=\"https://secure.wincent.com/a/store/\">payment options</a> for customers: <a href=\"http://www.kagi.com/\">Kagi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com/\">PayPal</a>. I think it&apos;s important to offer multiple alternatives because people generally have strong preferences when it comes to making online payments.</p>\n\n<p>In this article I want to talk about my recommendations to customers looking to buy a product and to developers looking to sell. The service that is best for you may vary according to which position you occupy.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000621more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>Customer recommendations</h4>\n\n<p>If a customer asks me which service I recommend I <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/faq/#which\">point out</a> that PayPal can generally offer more competitive prices because their fees are lower and because they don&apos;t charge VAT to European customers. So for customers, in many cases PayPal works out better; nevertheless some don&apos;t like it and chose to go with Kagi.</p>\n\n<p>In the distant past Kagi accepted payments from many more countries and it also accepted many more forms of payment, but as time goes by PayPal becomes available in more countries (over 100 at the time of writing) and they accept more types of payment. Kagi is on the move too, offering more currency options and updating their store infrastructure (to which I&apos;ve <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2006/10/kagi_store_pric.php\">just moved</a>).</p>\n\n<p>PayPal originally had an advantage because of its IPN (Instant Payment Notifications) service which allowed me to implement an automated system that instantly generated license codes for customers and sent them via email without any human intervention. Kagi had something called ACG (Activation Code Generator, I believe) which allowed you to do the same, but it required you to write the license code generator in a format specified by Kagi and then request them to install and run it on their own servers. They later caught up with PayPal and added KRPS (Kagi Remote Post System, I think) which is roughly equivalent to PayPal IPNs. In either case this means that from the customer perspective there&apos;s no difference in terms of how fast they get their license codes. Both processors seem to offer quite high reliability and availability. Scheduled maintenance stops people from using PayPal from time to time, and unscheduled maintenance is extremely rare with both companies.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize, the current state of play is that for customers, availability in different countries, currency options, payment types, instant delivery of license codes, reliability, are roughly equivalent with both services. Thanks to the <a href=\"https://secure.wincent.com/s/kagi/\">new Kagi store</a> infrastructure I&apos;m able to set prices in the same currency with both payment processors, so pricing is consistent as well (with the exception <a href=\"https://secure.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/purchase/\">noted here</a> that <a href=\"https://secure.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/\">Synergy</a> single-user licenses are cheaper via PayPal). That price discrepancy for Synergy single-user licenses and the fact that Kagi charges VAT to European customers are the only real reasons why I recommend that customers go with PayPal. One area in which Kagi makes up some ground is in customer service: if a customer wishes to speak to a human being at Kagi they&apos;ll find it fairly easy; contacting a human being at PayPal may be another matter entirely...</p>\n\n<h4>Developer recommendations</h4>\n\n<p>Kagi&apos;s fees are probably the real killer here and the single biggest disincentive to using Kagi. If your product costs more than 10 or 15&#x20AC; then you can probably absorb those higher fees and shield your customers from the damage. But in my case my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/\">most popular product</a> is only <a href=\"https://secure.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/purchase/\">5&#x20AC;</a> and Kagi&apos;s fees make it impossible to sell a product for so little; the same license <a href=\"https://secure.wincent.com/s/kagi/\">purchased via Kagi</a> costs 10&#x20AC;.</p>\n\n<p>For each 5&#x20AC; license I sell via PayPal, they take about 55 cents in fees. I can withdraw the money to my bank account for free. I don&apos;t have to pay currency conversion fees because the price of the software is set in euros, payments are made in euros, and the money is deposited into my account in euros. Funds are available instantly. This works out to just over 10% in fees.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kagi.com/solutions/pricing.html\">Kagi&apos;s fees</a>, on the other hand, work out to between 15% and 16%. Although prices are now set in euros, payments are sent from Kagi in US dollars and I am then at the mercy of my bank that sets its currency exchange rates as it pleases and where I also have to pay additional conversion fees at my end. Kagi levies a $15 &quot;Wire Transfer&quot; fee in order to obtain the money that they have collected on your behalf, and transfers are significantly delayed: in any given month you are not paid for the purchases made in that month until the 20th day of the following month, and your bank may impose a 28 day clearance delay on the incoming funds because they are in a foreign currency. If you&apos;re unlucky enough that the transfers coincide with weekends when banks are close then you could end up waiting as long as 83 days before receiving the money for a sale. When you take this delay into account and factor in the interest cost, this can easily drive up the Kagi fees to 20% or more, depending on your sales volume.</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s even worse than that though; the percentages above are calculated on the basis of the already-adjusted prices: that is, Kagi&apos;s fees are 15% to 16% when you sell your software for 10&#x20AC;. If you want to make the comparison totally fair then would have to calculate the percentage that you would pay if you kept the software at the lower price of 5&#x20AC;; in that case the fees go up to 32%. Add the wire transfer fees, currency conversion fees, and the interest cost of the delayed payment to you and your real fees can easily break the 35% or 40% barrier.</p>\n\n<p>So as I said, using Kagi is simply not realistic for extremely inexpensive software. Using it in other cases, however, may be attractive for one reason: Kagi&apos;s service to &quot;suppliers&quot; (that&apos;s Kagi lingo) is simply excellent.</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve never had any contact with a real human at PayPal. On the few occasions where I&apos;ve had contact it&apos;s been with an email auto-responder. With Kagi it&apos;s been a different story. Here&apos;s a quote from a Kagi representative in response to a comment about their fees:</p>\n\n<blockquote>In the past we have had supplier&apos;s [sic] who chose to leave Kagi because the fees at other companies looked more appealing. After a short time they returned to Kagi, as they realized the level of service and options available to them were no where near that of Kagi&apos;s. Although the fees may seem higher, if you actually were to sit down and look at the services available to you here versus another company I believe that you would be surprised at the service that Kagi offers.</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&apos;m afraid I have to begrudgingly agree: Kagi&apos;s service is second to none. Kagi isn&apos;t perfect and they do make some technical mistakes, but when those mistakes are made there&apos;s always a human being at the other end of the line to investigate and solve the problem. In setting up <a href=\"https://secure.wincent.com/s/kagi/\">the new store</a> I ran into various technical problems that seemed to be Kagi&apos;s fault &#x2014; factual errors in the help documentation and sample code; out-of-date templates; bugs and inadequacies in the custom order template system, and so forth &#x2014; but in all cases I was able to report the problem and receive a reply from someone at Kagi who took note of the issue for correction at some point in the future, and in the meantime worked to provide me with a different solution or workaround. The end result is that all of these technical issues have been solved and I have no complaints. The service has been simply excellent.</p>\n\n<p>So if you are a developer and your product&apos;s price point is high enough that you can withstand Kagi&apos;s fees, I recommend that you consider signing up with them. They offer quite a lot of services, they are flexible, and the service is excellent. They can compete with other payment processors such as PayPal in terms of reliability, payment, currency and language options. They do charge a lot, but when you interact with them it&apos;s easy to understand why: those fees cover the wages of the Kagi support staff. In short, Kagi is a lot more &quot;human&quot; and personalized than PayPal. More about &quot;people&quot;, less of a corporation.</p>\n</div></div>",

In the case where you undertake lots of refactoring and break lots of things setting &quot;Continue building after errors&quot; to on is probably the best thing you can do. Instead of repeating a build/fix-one-bug cycle/check-again-for-errors cycle, you can do a build/fix-lots-of-bugs/check-again-for-errors cycle. The compiler discovers more errors in each cycle because it continues building after the first error, so you can fix more bugs per cycle and spend less time waiting for builds to finish.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000674more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

There are still some minor issues and possible bugs in Leopard to solve (either bugs in Leopard or I&apos;m misunderstanding the documentation), but the workarounds currently in place all work and all tests pass. There were various problems which slowed me down along the way, but that&apos;s what you get when you&apos;re working with pre-release software; the actual coding in itself was very straightforward.</p>\n\n<p>I say &quot;pleasantly surprised&quot; because I feared that a low-level framework like WOTest would require a lot more work (being a unit-testing framework it does lots of low-level manipulation of the runtime). It turns out that the code looks a whole lot better (and shorter) thanks to Apple&apos;s changes. Will be able to talk about it all in more detail once Leopard is out and the NDAs no longer apply.</p>\n\n<p>The current plan is that the Tiger branch of WOTest will continue to run and work on Leopard, even though it makes use of some deprecated stuff in the runtime. This will be for use with non-garbage collected code. For work on garbage collected code the new Leopard-only code will be used.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000744more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

I tried to remove privacy on an expiring domain and then renew it, adding private registration, and GoDaddy&apos;s interface allows me to specify privacy in the lead-up to the checkout but on getting there there is no privacy in my cart and no apparent way to add it.</p>\n\n<h4>Updated workaround</h4>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=godaddy+%22promo+code%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">Search Google</a> for &apos;godaddy &quot;promo code&quot;&apos;.</li>\n<li>Remove privacy on the domain to be renewed.</li>\n<li>Renew it using a promo code. Today I was able to get a 10% discount by entering <tt>HASH3</tt> (found <a href=\"http://www.hostingadvices.com/godaddy-cheap-domain.php\">here</a>); so that&apos;s a one-year dot-com renewal for US$7.20, including the ICANN fee.</li>\n<li>After renewal is complete, add privacy again as a separate transaction; this will work. Again, try to find the best promo code you can; today I got 10% off using <tt>SAVENOW</tt> (found on <a href=\"http://www.hostingadvices.com/godaddy-cheap-domain.php\">the same page</a>), yielding private registration for US$4.49, all inclusive.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4>Drawbacks</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The total renewal price with privacy is <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/05/godaddys_renewa.php\">still too high</a> (US$11.69) but still better than the ridiculous US$18.19 that GoDaddy wanted to charge.</li>\n<li>The workaround requires you to perform two transactions instead of one.</li>\n<li>Given that the workaround involves two separate transactions, your personal information is exposed in the public WHOIS database for a longer period of time; still only a number of minutes, but annoying nonetheless. An additional annoyance was that during the period of vulnerability GoDaddy/Domains by Proxy provided an out-of-date email address in the WHOIS registry (a real account, not a spam honey-pot address); I have no idea why they published this information, seeing as I updated that email address with both GoDaddy/Domans by Proxy long ago.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div id=\"a000752more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>For the past two years I&apos;ve participated in the San Silvestre popular running race through Madrid on New Years Eve. This will be my third year in the 10Km race. As has been the case in previous years, this year&apos;s site is guilty of a number of heinous crimes against basic security and compatibility.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000814more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>Compatibility</h4>\n\n<p>The website this year is the worst ever. It displayed without errors in both Safari and Firefox, but just like last year, the payment page only works in Internet Explorer running on Windows.</p>\n\n<p>But the experience on Windows isn&apos;t great either. The site didn&apos;t work at all in either Internet Explorer or Firefox in Windows until I updated to the latest version of the Flash player, and no error message was shown when accessing the site with an older version installed. After upgrading the Flash player both browsers displayed the site, but as before the payment page provided by <a href=\"http://ibercaja.es/\">iberCaja</a> didn&apos;t work in Firefox. Worse still, the payment page wouldn&apos;t even open in Internet Explorer. I tried many times and on different days. I also tried with Opera; just like with Firefox the payment page refused to work.</p>\n\n<p>In all cases where the payment page didn&apos;t work, you would enter your credit card details, expiry date, security code, and press the (JavaScript-driven) submit button, only to find that nothing at all happened. I tried hacking the page source code using the Web Developer extension for Firefox, but there was nothing I could do to get the form to submit. Neither could I copy the form address back into Internet Explorer because it evidently depended on private data posted from the San Silvestre website. Being Flash, there was no way to inspect the source code of the site and work out how to correctly post to the payment form.</p>\n\n<p>Compatibility crimes summary:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>San Silvestre site requires ultra-recent version of Flash player.</li>\n<li>San Silvestre site doesn&apos;t fail gracefully if required version is not present; fails silently (blank page).</li>\n<li>San Silvestre site, in order to jump to the payments page, requires Internet Explorer, running on Windows.</li>\n<li>San Silvestre site doesn&apos;t explicitly mention requirements anywhere.</li>\n<li>San Silvestre site gets bonus points for allowing user to uselessly invest time filling out forms before failing.</li>\n<li>San Silvestre site&apos;s use of Flash prevents trouble-shooting efforts that would have been possible by inspecting HTML source.\n</li><li>iberCaja payment page unnecessarily relies on JavaScript.</li>\n<li>iberCaja payment page only works in Internet Explorer running on Windows.</li>\n<li>iberCaja payment page doesn&apos;t explicitly state its requirements anywhere.</li>\n<li>iberCaja payment page doesn&apos;t degrade or fail gracefully in other browsers, or if you try with JavaScript turned off.</li>\n<li>iberCaja payment page also gets bonus points for allowing the user to uselessly invest time filling out forms before failing, and <em>bonus</em> bonus points for overriding the default movement behaviour between text fields (make an error typing in your credit card number and you&apos;ll find that you can&apos;t shift-tab back in order to correct it).\n</li></ul>\n\n<h4>Security</h4>\n\n<p>Security crimes summary:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The San Silvestre website allows you to obtain the DNI (national identity document) number of anyone participating merely by knowing or guessing their email address (with around 20,000 participants, it shouldn&apos;t be too hard to locate a target).</li>\n<li>If you also know the participant&apos;s date of birth you can then find out their address, phone numbers, even their shirt size. You may also be able to find out their running club and whether or not they have their own &quot;chip&quot;.</li>\n<li>Given the DNI, the San Silvestre website allows you to find out the full name, surname(s), date of birth, and sex of the participant.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is the most basic security stuff. Disappointing that they can&apos;t get it right.</p>\n\n<h4>General cluelessness</h4>\n\n<p>After trying many times I noted with some alarm that there were less than 1,000 places left in the race and decided to go to one of the listed registration points (mostly Nike stores around Madrid) only to find that entries were exhausted wherever I went.  The helpful folks in the stores told me that my best bet was to register via the Internet. As if I hadn&apos;t already tried...</p>\n\n<p>The 902 (high cost) phone number listed on the San Silvestre website didn&apos;t work (calls simply dropped out mid-way through). By the time I got home the website had been updated to indicate that places were no longer available at any of the outlets and that the only way to register was via the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>In my desperation I thought I&apos;d give it one more try. Turns out that the solution in the end was to <em>not</em> use the &quot;sign up again&quot; link that the organizers had emailed me weeks before. This was a link that prepopulated the form for me with my details from the previous year. By forgetting about this link and going in directly from the front page and typing in the form details from scratch I found that things finally worked: Internet Explorer on Windows XP SP2 finally allowed me to open up the payment page and make my payment.</p>\n\n<p>In switching to this alternate method I also noticed that several bugs which manifested themselves in the prepopulated version of the form were no longer present. For example, the website no longer informed me that I had to specify my sex even though it was clearly already specified. Yet more evidence that this site is inadequately-tested, incompatible, insecure, poorly-designed trash. However got pad for developing the site is little better than an incompetent con-artist.</p>\n\n<p>All in all my repeated registration attempts and the time wasted trying to enrol in person cost me about two hours. I hope they improve the site for next year.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>There are some things that I wish someone had told me when I got started programming Cocoa four years ago. There&apos;s a lot to learn, of course, so even if they <em>had</em> told me (and let&apos;s be honest, they probably <em>did</em> tell me) I may not have realized the importance of the advice.</p>\n\n<p>So as you go you do your best to adhere to the &quot;best practices&quot;. Sometimes you find out you made a mistake and have to go back. Other times you find out that the &quot;best practice&quot; wasn&apos;t really the best practice for a given situation. And as you look back over the years you see work that needs to be redone, and perhaps you wish you could have done it the &quot;right way&quot; the first time. Sometimes code that works isn&apos;t good enough; sometimes, even if you&apos;re not a perfectionist, you have to rewrite working code or restructure a working build process in order to enable or accommodate future growth. Sometimes, even if you think &quot;if it ain&apos;t broke don&apos;t fix it&quot;, you still have to go back in and &quot;fix&quot; it.</p>\n\n<p>So I&apos;d like to offer some very brief advice in this post for Cocoa beginners which may or may not save some effort later on down the track.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000815more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>Subversion from Day 1</h4>\n\n<p>Use Subversion or some other good version control system from day one, even if you&apos;re working alone. Version control provides you with structure, is an additional form of backup, facilitates the production of changelogs and release notes, encourages a disciplined approach to coding in which you tackle discrete problems or issues one at a time.</p>\n\n<h4>Write frameworks judiciously</h4>\n\n<p>Don&apos;t bundle everything up in frameworks for re-use unless you&apos;re really sure it belongs in a framework. For a small independent software vendor, frameworks make sense only for discrete, self-contained pieces of functionality that require bundled resources along with them (nibs, graphics, localizations etc). Examples of good justifications for a framework are specific tasks like delivering application updates, embedding a crash-reporter/crash-catcher application, unit testing, or offering bezel or hot key services.</p>\n\n<p>You guessed it, the example purposes I list above are all specific tasks that I&apos;ve created frameworks for. But in the case of more general, non-specific code, the best thing you can do is stick it in a Subversion repository and share it across projects by using a Subversion externals definition. You pull in only the specific classes, categories and files that you need. Your apps will build faster, have smaller memory footprints, and the build cycle will be less complicated</p>\n\n<p>This was a painful lesson for me to learn. Three years ago I started sticking common code in a base framework called WOBase. In August this year I realized that WOBase had become too big and sprawling to make its reuse reasonable in new, small projects. Since then I&apos;ve been dismantling the monolith that is WOBase and sticking it in a Subversion repository as a collection of reusable atomic components. I use only the bits and pieces that are appropriate for each task. This migration has taken me literally months, undoing and modifying nearly three years of construction.</p>\n\n<p>If I had known about Subversion externals sooner I might have taken this decision earlier and saved myself a lot of work.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing I wished I had known about earlier is the <tt>BUNDLE_LOADER</tt> build setting. Prior to learning about that I stuck all my common code for <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> in a framework of its own. In this way preference panes, plug-in bundles, and the application itself could all benefit from the same code. But making a framework increased the complexity of my build chain, my dependency graph, and lengthened my build times.</p>\n\n<p><tt>BUNDLE_LOADER</tt> makes that all unnecessary. The common code now resides in the application, and when building plug-ins and other bundles which depend on that code you instruct the linker to look for any missing symbols in the application. No more framework. Not only are the builds faster but application load times are as well. If I had known about <tt>BUNDLE_LOADER</tt> I could have saved a considerable volume of work.</p>\n\n<h4>Unit test from Day 1</h4>\n\n<p>Write concise unit tests from day one. I&apos;ve been doing this for a while now, but I wish I&apos;d been doing it for longer. Unit tests provide you with confidence that your code works as you think it does and give you the courage to make necessary changes fearlessly (without worrying about undetected breakage). The better your unit tests, the better your confidence can be. Measuring code coverage can also help increase your confidence.</p>\n\n<h4>Doxygen</h4>\n\n<p>Use <a href=\"http://doxygen.org/\">Doxgen</a> to document your code, even if it is not for a public audience.</p>\n\n<p>Writing a program is really a three-fold thing, comprising three interdependent activities:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The code itself: does what you think it should do</li>\n<li>The unit tests: confirm that the code does what you think it should do</li>\n<li>The documentation: explicitly states what you think the code should do</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In reality, the three are closely interwoven and you often go back and forth between writing each. For example, sometimes the things you&apos;ve specified in the documentation provide you with a guide for what you should test in your unit tests; and in turn, your unit tests help you decide what to write (and when to stop writing) in the code.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, if you code is not for a public audience nor for use in a team your documentation need not be like Apple&apos;s, but it is probably a good idea to at a minimum provide a one-line description for each class and method; this will enforce a discipline, requiring you to think more about the <em>design</em> of your classes. Likewise, you should document, at a minimum, the expectations each method has with respect to input parameters, what gets returned from the method, and what kinds of exception might be thrown and when/why.</p>\n\n<h4>Branching</h4>\n\n<p>Branching enables you to do stuff like release one version of your software for Tiger and another for Leopard. You can optionally merge changes <em>en masse</em> or selectively (&quot;cherry picking&quot;) between branches.</p>\n\n<p>Branches are useful, but the key advice here is: branch late. Each branch means more work, so branch as late as possible and only when you&apos;re sure that it&apos;s the right moment to do so.</p>\n\n<h4>Xcode configuration files</h4>\n\n<p>Or <tt>xcconfig</tt> files. The advice here is short: use them. I wish I&apos;d known about them sooner (or that they&apos;d been introduced sooner, or both!).</p>\n\n<h4>Practise</h4>\n\n<p>The last bit of advice is that you practise, practise, practise. There are a lot of patterns to learn in Cocoa, and learning these is more important than learning any specific API. There will always be new API to learn, but if you can master the basic Cocoa patterns then you&apos;ll be able to easily master and use new APIs as they emerge.</p>\n\n<p>And when it comes to Cocoa patterns and ideas in computer science in general, the best way to learn them is simply to do. Model/View/Controller (MVC), Cocoa Bindings, Key-Value Coding (KVC), Key-Value Observering (KVO), action/target, delegates, datasources, Core Data, singleton patterns, locking patterns, accessor patterns, memory barriers etc.</p>\n\n<p>You can try to learn about this stuff by reading, but in the end the only way to really master it is by doing. Write code, read the mailing lists, ask questions, answer them. Make mistakes, learn from them. After four years of working with Cocoa I look back and see that I have learned an incredible amount, but I also know that, as Yoda would say, much to learn, I still have. It&apos;s important encourage that learning process as much as possible and that means getting your hands on the code.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Over the last month I&apos;ve spent a few hours making minor improvements to the navigability of the site. Visitors should now find it a little bit easier to move around the site. These are minor polish details, the kind of stuff you might not even notice unless I told you about it; so here I am to, er, tell you about it.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000646more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>Down with Movable Type search, long live Google search</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://google.com/\">Google</a> is now so good that it does a better job of searching this site than does the built-in <a href=\"http://www.movabletype.org/\">Movable Type</a> search functionality. It&apos;s better because it&apos;s quick, the index is frequently updated, and it allows me to provide a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/site-map/search/\">unified site-wide search</a> that returns results from all areas of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/\">wincent.com</a>, not just the parts that a powered by Movable Type (the Movable Type only search engine probably caused more confusion than anything else, as it wouldn&apos;t find pages in the <a href=\"http://forums.wincent.com/\">forums</a>, in the <a href=\"http://bugs.wincent.com/\">bugs and feature requests database</a>, in the <a href=\"http://lists.wincent.com/\">mailing list archives</a> or in the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/\">Knowledge Base wiki</a>).</p>\n\n<p>You can access the site wide search by clicking on &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/site-map/search/\">Search</a>&quot;, which appears under the &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/site-map/\">Site Map</a>&quot; button in the navigation bar at the top of (almost) every page in this site:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"site-search.png\" src=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/site-search.png\" width=\"341\" height=\"102\"></p>\n\n<h4>General cleanup</h4>\n\n<p>Fixed some broken links. Fixed a number of places where you could click an item in the &quot;bread crumb&quot; trail that appears below the navigation bar and wind up at a non-existent page; now clicking on such links redirects you to the corresponding archives. </p>\n\n<h4>Subversion log</h4>\n\n<p>The Subversion log which appears in the bottom portion of the left-hand column on <a href=\"http://colaiuta.net/\">my weblog</a> has been significantly improved.</p>\n\n<p>Clicking on an entry in the <a href=\"feed://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/atom.xml\">feed</a> now takes you to a separate page for that entry (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2006/11/synergy_advance_r333_14_items.php\">example entry</a>). Previously there were no such individual pages and you were taken to a gigantic page listing all of the entries.</p>\n\n<p>Now there are individual pages with forward and back links; there is now a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/\">master archive index</a> with links to month-based archives (all updates for a month on a single page; <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2006/11/\">example archive</a>). The month-based archives also have forward and back links. Both individual entries and month-based archives also have links which take you back to the master archive index.<br>\n <br>\n</p><h4>Mini-log</h4><p></p>\n\n<p>Much the same treatment has been given to the &quot;Mini-log&quot; in the left-hand column of <a href=\"http://colaiuta.net/\">my weblog</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are now individual entry pages (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/mini-log/archives/2006/10/interface_build.php\">example entry</a>) linked to from the <a href=\"feed://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/mini-log/atom.xml\">feed</a>, date-based archives (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/mini-log/archives/2006/10/\">example archive</a>), and a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/mini-log/archives/index.php\">master archive index</a> that provides links to the date-based archives.</p>\n\n<p>Individual entries and date based archives feature forward and back links, as well as &quot;up&quot; links to the master archive index.</p>\n\n<h4>Quick links</h4>\n\n<p>Again, improvements to the archives for the &quot;Quick links&quot; section that appears in the left column of the <a href=\"http://wincent.org/\">main site news page</a>: individual entry pages (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/quick-links/archives/2006/11/flickrexport_fo_4.php\">example</a>) linked to from the <a href=\"feed://wincent.com/a/news/quick-links/atom.xml\">feed</a> with forward and back links,  and an &quot;up&quot; link to the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/quick-links/archives/\">master archive index</a> (previously there was just one gigantic page containing all the entries ever posted). The master archive index provides links to new date-based archive pages (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/quick-links/archives/2006/10/\">example</a>).</p>\n\n<h4>Personal weblog</h4>\n\n<p>There were some places where you could hit a non-existent page if you tried moving &quot;up&quot; a level by manually deleting the last component in a URL; now in most of these places you either see an appropriate index or be redirected to the archives.</p>\n\n<p>Most of these &quot;holes&quot; have been filled in thanks to the introduction of date-based archives (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/11/\">example archive</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Category archives now show a list of article titles rather than titles plus excerpts (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/opinion/\">example</a>); this is to keep the category archive pages down to a reasonable size. The date-based archives should be more reasonable in size, so those do include excerpts as well as titles.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/\">master archive index</a> is now a set of links to the date-based archives instead of a gigantic long list of titles.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://colaiuta.net/\">front page</a> now includes a link to the archives at the bottom of the article listing.</p>\n\n<h4>Product and site news</h4>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/\">master archive index</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/\">product and site news</a> section is now a set of links to the date-based archives instead of a gigantic long list of titles.</p>\n\n<h4>Parting comments</h4>\n\n<p>Please <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/contact/mail/\">let me know if you</a> find any broken links or have any suggestions for other improvements to the navigability of the site.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Back in August <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/08/thoughts_on_hig.php\">I wrote the following</a> about HOM (Higher Order Messaging):</p>\n\n<blockquote>It reads like natural language but behind the scenes there&apos;s an invisible trampoline object that does the work. The first message returns this invisible object with which you never need interact knowingly, and that invisible object mysteriously captures the message that you send it, the message that you really want to send to the objects in the collection, and then it does something with it.<br>\n<br>\nYes, it works; yes, it allows you to write shorter, more compact code using a natural-language style. But it just feels wrong.</blockquote>\n\n<p>I had already used a HOM-style syntax for my mock object implementation in my <a href=\"http://test.wincent.com/\">WOTest</a> Objective-C unit testing framework, although I never really felt convinced that it was the &quot;right thing&quot; to do.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday, I allowed true HOM to creep into WOCommon in the form of an <tt>ifResponds</tt> implementation.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000909more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>The problem</h4>\n\n<p>Sick of writing things like:</p>\n\n<pre>if ([object respondsToSelector:@selector(foo)])\n    return [object performSelector:@selector(foo)];</pre>\n\n<p>I had long ago added a method to <tt>NSObject</tt> via a category that enabled me to write:</p>\n\n<pre>return [object performSelectorIfResponds:@selector(foo)];</pre>\n\n<p>What if the message you wish to send has an object parameter? The obvious solution is to also provide a <tt>performSelectorIfResponds:withObject:</tt> method, a parallel of Foundation&apos;s <tt>performSelector:withObject:</tt> method.</p>\n\n<p>Two object parameters? Whip up a <tt>performSelectorIfResponds:withObject:withObject:</tt> partner to go with the <tt>performSelector:withObject:withObject:</tt> method already provided by Foundation.</p>\n\n<p>But if you want to go beyond three object parameters things start to feel distinctly kludgy (if they didn&apos;t already!). We can&apos;t keep on adding additional &quot;withObject:&quot; parameters forever. Ideally, it would be nice to have a method which took a variable number of arguments:</p>\n\n<pre>- (id)performSelectorIfResponds:(SEL)aSelector \n                    withObjects:(id)firstObject, ...</pre>\n\n<p>But writing such a method is not as easy as you might think. The first step (checking to see if an object responds to a selector) is easy, but the second step (dispatching the message) is not as straightforward.</p>\n\n<p>The Objective-C runtime does provide two variants of the basic message dispatch function, <tt>objc_msgSend</tt> and <tt>objc_msgSendv</tt>, but they don&apos;t work the same way that <tt>NSLog</tt> and <tt>NSLogv</tt> do. <tt>objc_msgSendv</tt> uses an arcane type called a <tt>marg_list</tt> whereas <tt>NSLogv</tt> uses a <tt>va_list</tt>. A <tt>va_list</tt> is easy to work with using the <tt>va_start</tt> and <tt>va_end</tt> macros but a <tt>marg_list</tt> is not. As far as I know there is only one place in the runtime where you get handed a <tt>marg_list</tt> and that&apos;s in the undocumented but semi-public <tt>forward::</tt> method (semi-public because you can learn about it by exploring the Darwin source code).</p>\n\n<p>So if you want to handle a variable number of arguments you&apos;re going to need a proxy object that implements <tt>forward::</tt> and if you&apos;re going to do that you may as well give in and just do it the HOM way and write an <tt>ifResponds</tt> implementation that allows you to write code like the following:</p>\n\n<pre>return [[object ifResponds] replaceOccurencesOf:@&quot;foo&quot; with:@&quot;bar&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>You see, one of my objections to HOM was that it felt to me like a solution looking for a problem. But in the case of the example under discussion now it really does seem to be addressing a real need. The need is that you want to be able to elegantly handle a variable number of parameters. I admit that the &quot;need&quot; only arose because I wanted to avoid the <tt>respondsToSelector:</tt>/<tt>performSelector:</tt> pattern mentioned above, but the truth is that that pattern doesn&apos;t work cleanly anyway when you want to send a message with more than two parameters:</p>\n\n<pre>if ([object respondsToSelector:@selector(foo:bar:foobar:)])\n{\n    // unless object is of type &quot;id&quot; compiler will complain here that it may not respond to &quot;foo:bar:foobar:&quot;\n    return [object foo:@&quot;1&quot; bar:@&quot;2&quot; foobar:@&quot;3&quot;];\n<br>\n    // to suppress the warning you could do an unsightly cast to id\n    return [(id)object foo:@&quot;1&quot; bar:@&quot;2&quot; foobar:@&quot;3&quot;];\n<br>\n    // or a cast to the specific object that you think you&apos;re working with\n    return [(MyFancyObject *)object foo:@&quot;1&quot; bar:@&quot;2&quot; foobar:@&quot;3&quot;];\n<br>\n    // or drop down to the runtime level\n    return objc_msgSend(object, @selector(foo:bar:foobar:), @&quot;1&quot;, @&quot;2&quot;, @&quot;3&quot;);\n}</pre>\n\n<h4>The verdict on <tt>ifResponds</tt></h4>\n\n<p>So does the <tt>ifResponds</tt> HOM pattern come out in front when we compare it with the <tt>performSelectorIfResponds:</tt> method?</p>\n\n<p>Strong points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shorter syntax</li>\n<li>Works out of the box with any number of parameters</li>\n<li>Requires only one method, <tt>ifResponds</tt>, to be added to the <tt>NSObject</tt> namespace (unlike the <tt>withObject:</tt> variants of <tt>performSelectorIfResponds:</tt>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Weak points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Requires non-obvious invisible trampoline object behind the scenes (which is what I wrote about <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/08/thoughts_on_hig.php\">here</a>)</li>\n<li>Runs slower due to said secret magic</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Neutral points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Neither method relies on any undocumented or private API so shouldn&apos;t break when run on Leopard</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Weighing these things up, HOM seems like a winner, unless speed is really important to you. How slow is slow? About 100 times slower, believe it or not; here are the results of a quick, unscientific test that I did comparing the speed of four different methods, each doing an &quot;if responds, perform selector&quot; operation 10 million times:</p>\n\n<pre>Convenience version: 0.674308\nHOM version        : 56.451863\nTraditional version: 0.515416\nRuntime version    : 0.388666</pre>\n\n<p>The &quot;convenience version&quot; uses the <tt>performSelectorIfResponds:</tt> method. The &quot;traditional&quot; version uses a <tt>respondsToSelector:</tt>/<tt>performSelector:</tt> pair. The &quot;runtime&quot; version drops the <tt>performSelector:</tt> message in favor of directly calling <tt>objc_msgSend</tt>.</p>\n\n<p>Why is it so much slower? The traditional version requires two explicit message sends; the convenience version is a little slower because it wraps those message sends up in a method and incurs an additional message send; the HOM version instantiates a proxy object (relatively costly compared to a basic message send) and then involves the entire NSInvocation machinery, and I suspect it&apos;s this latter element which makes it so dastardly slow.</p>\n\n<p>Admittedly, this is plain, unoptimized HOM, but the moral of the story remains, don&apos;t use the HOM version in tight loops; it is best left for cases where it will be used infrequently. </p>\n\n<h4>Is HOM really HOM?</h4>\n\n<p>In working writing the <tt>ifResponds</tt> implementation and writing this article another reason for feeling uncomfortable with HOM dawned on me. It seems that HOM isn&apos;t really HOM, not in the strictest sense.</p>\n\n<p>HOM stands for &quot;Higher Order Messaging&quot;. &quot;Higher Order&quot; or &quot;meta&quot; because the idea is that instead of sending a message to an object, you send a message to a message. But Objective-C doesn&apos;t really allow that; it only allows you to send messages to objects. The HOM implementation tries to give you what you would have if you really could send a message to a message, but in reality if you look at the code it&apos;s just a string of normal send-a-message-to-an-object message sends.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dpompa.com/?p=33\">Ofri Wolfus</a> has recently been trying to innovate in the HOM space with a framework that encapsulates messages inside message objects. In a sense it is a more &quot;honest&quot; implementation of HOM because it embraces Objective-C&apos;s flavor of Object Orientation; that you encapsulate &quot;stuff&quot; in objects and then pass those objects around via messaging. Ofri seems to be a very clever guy and it looks like his framework is both efficient and full-featured despite being at an early stage of development. I admit though that I find the macros and syntax that he&apos;s come up with to be fairly unwieldy.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://notahat.com/nhcollections\">Pete Yandell</a> has also been trying to break the mould a little bit and his HOM framework looks to be one of the simplest out there. The basic design is a big strong point, in my opinion, but I&apos;ll bet that his implementation, like Ofri&apos;s, suffers from the same speed problems that plague anything that relies on NSInvocation. It seems that to get really fast HOM you&apos;d need to take NSInvocation out of the picture, and if that&apos;s not possible at least minimize it&apos;s role. Once you go down that road you have to start meddling at a pretty low level with the runtime and you risk incompatibility with Objective-C 2.0 or other changes that Apple might make in Leopard or later; likewise you probably also make your code more brittle and architecture dependent. I know that Ofri has been working on this, and I believe that Marcel Weiher (author of one of the first frameworks designated as &quot;HOM&quot; for Objective-C) has also optimized the pattern fairly heavily. But I am at this stage only a HOM dabbler and I haven&apos;t looked at their code nor the optimizations that they&apos;ve undertaken.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>A couple of days ago I <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/11/more_thoughts_o.php\">wrote</a> about my first venture into HOM (Higher Order Messaging) in the form of a <tt>ifResponds</tt> selector.</p>\n\n<p>I included some results that showed that the HOM implementation was about 100 times slower than the non-HOM version, but I probably should have added that the &quot;if responds&quot; HOM is pretty much a worst-case scenario. You go through all the set-up and overhead for a once-off message send. Compare that to the collection HOMs where you can incur that set-up cost once and then iterate cheaply over a collection that may contain hundreds, thousands or even millions of items.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000918more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>Performance</h4>\n\n<p>So I went ahead and implemented some more HOM selectors, <tt>detach</tt>, <tt>perform</tt> (I chose &quot;perform&quot; rather than &quot;do&quot; because the latter is a C language keyword, and besides, &quot;perform&quot; is common Objective-C parlance), and <tt>collect</tt>. The &quot;collect&quot; HOM is the first that can iterate over a collection, so here are some updated test results:</p>\n\n<pre>&quot;If responds&quot; HOM tests:\n    Convenience version : Usage: 0.063110/0.000427/0.063537 (user/system/total)\n    HOM version         : Usage: 4.173793/0.167678/4.341471 (user/system/total)\n    Traditional version : Usage: 0.050435/0.000294/0.050729 (user/system/total)\n    Runtime version     : Usage: 0.039302/0.000225/0.039527 (user/system/total)\n<br>\n&quot;Collect&quot; HOM tests (tiny array, 1 elements):\n    HOM version         : Usage: 0.000192/0.000080/0.000272 (user/system/total)\n    Traditional version : Usage: 0.000020/0.000004/0.000024 (user/system/total)\n<br>\n&quot;Collect&quot; HOM tests (small array, 10 elements):\n    HOM version         : Usage: 0.000124/0.000007/0.000131 (user/system/total)\n    Traditional version : Usage: 0.000051/0.000004/0.000055 (user/system/total)\n<br>\n&quot;Collect&quot; HOM tests (medium array, 100 elements):\n    HOM version         : Usage: 0.000560/0.000025/0.000585 (user/system/total)\n    Traditional version : Usage: 0.000370/0.000026/0.000396 (user/system/total)\n<br>\n&quot;Collect&quot; HOM tests (big array, 1000 elements):\n    HOM version         : Usage: 0.005044/0.000229/0.005273 (user/system/total)\n    Traditional version : Usage: 0.003596/0.000204/0.003800 (user/system/total)\n<br>\n&quot;Collect&quot; HOM tests (bigger array, 10000 elements):\n    HOM version         : Usage: 0.048220/0.001478/0.049698 (user/system/total)\n    Traditional version : Usage: 0.034332/0.000836/0.035168 (user/system/total)\n<br>\n&quot;Collect&quot; HOM tests (biggest array, 100000 elements):\n    HOM version         : Usage: 0.490689/0.015145/0.505834 (user/system/total)\n    Traditional version : Usage: 0.358335/0.018534/0.376869 (user/system/total)</pre>\n\n<p>While the &quot;if responds&quot; HOM is about 100 times slower than the non-HOM equivalent, the &quot;collect&quot; HOM is only 10 times slower in the worst case scenario (iterating over a collection that contains only a single element) and in the best case scenario tested (100,000 elements) it was only 30% slower. This is for a completely unoptimized implementation which doesn&apos;t take any tricky shortcuts with the runtime and which should work unmodified on any version of Mac OS X.</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s interesting to compare these speed figures with the results reported in Marcel Weiher&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.metaobject.com/papers/Higher_Order_Messaging_OOPSLA_2005.pdf\">HOM paper</a> (co-authored with St&#xE9;phane Ducasse), which were collected using &quot;techniques for optimizing message sends&quot;:</p>\n\n<table width=\"100%\">\n<tr><th>Array size</th> <th>HOM relative speed (optimized)</th> <th>HOM relative speed (unoptimized)</th></tr>\n<tr><td>1</td>          <td>Not tested</td>                     <td>1133%</td></tr>\n<tr><td>10</td>         <td>218%</td>                           <td>238%</td></tr>\n<tr><td>100</td>        <td>122%</td>                           <td>148%</td></tr>\n<tr><td>1000</td>       <td>98%</td>                            <td>139%</td></tr>\n<tr><td>10000</td>      <td>94%</td>                            <td>141%</td></tr>\n<tr><td>100000</td>     <td>Not tested</td>                     <td>134%</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>So for very small collections the performance difference is negligible, but as the collection size grows the optimized HOM implementation approaches better-than-100% performance penalty whereas the non-optimized case tends towards somewhere between 130 and 140% performance penalty. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_(computer_science)\">Premature optimization is the root of all evil</a>, so I think I&apos;ll leave things the way they are until real-application profiling indicates that I should be optimizing my HOM stuff or replacing it with non-HOM alternatives.</p>\n\n<h4>Is HOM really HOM?</h4>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/11/more_thoughts_o.php\">my last article</a> on HOM, I asked, is HOM really HOM? The &quot;higher order&quot; part of HOM refers to the fact that you&apos;re sending a message to a message. Well, actually, that&apos;s only what you <em>want</em> to do:</p>\n\n<pre>[collection select: hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>But that&apos;s not valid Objective-C. You can&apos;t pass a message as a parameter to another message. The alternative, idealized syntax (also invalid) won&apos;t work either:</p>\n\n<pre>[collection select hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>Actually-existing HOM is not actually HOM at all, a point that even <a href=\"http://www.metaobject.com/papers/Higher_Order_Messaging_OOPSLA_2005.pdf\">the seminal paper on HOM</a> admits, although I didn&apos;t realize that it made this admission until I read the paper yesterday:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Objective-C ... [doesn&apos;t] support sending messages as a parameter to another message, not even syntactically. What is supported, however, is messages taking objects as arguments, so we need to somehow bridge this gap.<br>\n<br>\n[I]nstead of passing the argument message to the prefix message directly, which isn&apos;t possible, [in Higher Order Messaging] the prefix message returns an object that is then sent the argument message.</blockquote>\n\n<p>So HOM doesn&apos;t actually exist, except as a theoretical ideal. What does exist is an working model that is equivalent in functional terms to the theoretical ideal. No &quot;higher order&quot; messages are actually sent, but the end result is just the same as if they were. Knowing that this fact is acknowledged by the originators of the &quot;HOM&quot; moniker makes me feel a lot more comfortable than I <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/08/thoughts_on_hig.php\">did before</a> with the whole idea.</p>\n\n<p>Still, I think there <em>may</em> be a problem here. It&apos;s entirely suitable to invent a new term to describe a different kind of messaging (messages that take messages as parameters). But it probably causes confusion when you then apply that term to something that doesn&apos;t actually exist yet; what we call &quot;HOM&quot; today isn&apos;t HOM: it&apos;s Traditional Messaging That Allows Us To Obtain A Result That&apos;s Approximately Equivalent To What We&apos;d Get If We Had A Real HOM Implementation. I guess that &quot;TMTAUTOARTAETWWGIWHARHI&quot; is not as catchy as HOM. I think the cognitive dissonance provoked by the gap between the term and the reality goes a long way to explaining my resistance to HOM in the past.</p>\n\n<p>I can partly explain my response in the following manner. The part of HOM which is indisputably true is the &quot;Messaging&quot; part. Messaging is definitely occurring. But what is &quot;higher order&quot; about actually-existing implementations of HOM? There&apos;s a trampoline involved, but the trampoline is just a good old fashioned proxy. There is nothing at all new about sending a message to something (a proxy) and having the proxy forward that message the real recipient.</p>\n\n<p>Existing implementations of HOM feel more like &quot;abstraction&quot; than anything &quot;higher order&quot;. Let&apos;s take the &quot;collect&quot; HOM as an example. Isn&apos;t it just abstraction of the iteration pattern? &quot;Abstraction&quot; because iteration is still definitely happening under the hood; but you hide it under an abstraction layer. The actual messy work is encapsulated out of sight inside the proxy, but underneath it all it&apos;s still the same old iterative code, and if anything it&apos;s even uglier because of the elaborate forwarding and runtime manipulation required to get the trampoline working in the first place.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dpompa.com/?p=33\">Ofri Wolfus</a> passes a message encapsulated inside an object. As such it seems less &quot;higher order&quot; than Marcel Weiher&apos;s implementation. &quot;Less&quot; because there is less invisible magic going on. It&apos;s all out in the open. It&apos;s a case of &quot;I&apos;m going to send you this message (encapsulated in an object because that&apos;s the way message sending actually works in Objective-C), and then I want you to send it to every item in the collection&quot;. The drawback is that the code is more verbose and quite ugly (see the example below), and it kind of defeats the whole purpose of HOM (let the programmer think about intention rather than implementation details).</p>\n\n<pre>[[myArray select] hasPrefix:@&quot;a&quot;];              // &quot;traditional&quot; HOM\n[myArray selectWhere:MSG(hasPrefix:@&quot;a&quot;), nil]; // Wolfus version\n<br>\n[[myArray selectWhere] capitalizedString] hasPrefix:@&quot;a&quot;];              // &quot;traditional&quot; HOM\n[myArray selectWhere:MSG(capitalizedString), MSG(hasPrefix:@&quot;a&quot;), nil]; // Wolfus version\n<br>\n[[[myArray selectWhere] valueForKey:@&quot;capitalizedString.lastPathComponent&quot;] hasPrefix:@&quot;a&quot;];    // &quot;traditional&quot; HOM\n[myArray selectWhere:MSG(capitalizedString), MSG(lastPathComponent), MSG(hasPrefix:@&quot;a&quot;), nil]; // Wolfus version</pre>\n\n<p>Compare that with <a href=\"http://www.metaobject.com/Research.html\">Marcel Weiher&apos;s version</a>: the intention is clear even if the mechanism is not. Clear because the thing reads similar to natural language and it&apos;s not cluttered with visible secondary implementation details. But the mechanism is not clear because it&apos;s all happening with secret behind-the-scenes sauce. You don&apos;t have to bundle up the message, you just send it like you would anyway. There is less of an obstacle between formulating your intention and actually expressing it; you just do it. In other words, your intention is to send a message to the items in a collection, so what do you do? You send the message! The actual recipient of the message you send is an invisible proxy, but at least at a cursory glance it looks like you&apos;re sending the message to the collection itself if you overlook the nitty gritty syntax; so you&apos;re working with the collection as a whole in a way that affects the individual components. It&apos;s therefore <em>like</em> Higher Order Messaging even if there is nothing <em>actually</em> &quot;higher order&quot; about it.</p>\n\n<h4>Next...</h4>\n\n<p>I&apos;ll have more to say on <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/hom/\">HOM</a> within the next few days.

    "html": "<p>The &quot;select&quot; HOM is one of the most frequently used patterns in any demonstration of HOM yet ironically it is also the most difficult to implement due to a quirk in the way the compiler and runtime work. Given code like the following:</p>\n\n<pre>NSArray *selection = [[array select] hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>The compiler will warn:</p>\n\n<pre>warning: initialization makes pointer from integer without a cast</pre>\n\n<p>The compiler expects <tt>hasPrefix:</tt> to return a <tt>BOOL</tt> yet it sees that result being assigned to a pointer to an object <tt>id</tt> and hence issues a warning. As will be shown below this is not just a compile-time problem but a run-time one as well. If we try casting to <tt>id</tt> we get a different warning; this code:</p>\n\n<pre>NSArray *selection = (id)[[array select] hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>Yields the following warning:</p>\n\n<pre>warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size</pre>\n\n<p>The compiler here warns that an integer (a <tt>BOOL</tt>, one byte in size on Intel) is being cast to a pointer (an integer of four bytes in size when running on a 32-bit architecture). Even if our HOM implementation returns a real pointer in response to the <tt>hasPrefix:</tt> selector, the code generated by the compiler will truncate it and return a mangled, broken, one-byte version.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000923more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>Digging deeper</h4>\n\n<p>So there are two levels on which the problem needs to be addressed: firstly, the compile-time issue (how do we eliminate compiler warnings and errors?) and secondly, the run-time issue (how do we get the code to actually do what we want it to do?).</p>\n\n<p>The cause of the confusion is that the compiler will find a method signature that looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre>- (BOOL)hasPrefix:(NSString *)prefix;</pre>\n\n<p>You could declare another one, which returns type <tt>id</tt>:</p>\n\n<pre>- (id)hasPrefix:(NSString *)prefix;</pre>\n\n<p>But then the compiler would complain as follows:</p>\n\n<pre>warning: multiple methods named &#x2018;-hasPrefix:&#x2019; found\nwarning: using &#x2018;-(BOOL)hasPrefix:(NSString *)aString&#x2019;</pre>\n\n<p>You can&apos;t trick the compiler to use the one you want by merely casting:</p>\n\n<pre>// compiler will still use the BOOL variant\n(id)[object hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>There are only two ways to explicitly force the compiler to use the version you want. One is to cast to a specific class; for example, given the following interface:</p>\n\n<pre>@interface Hack : NSObject\n- (id)hasPrefix:(NSString *)prefix;\n@end</pre>\n\n<p>You could explicitly cast to <tt>Hack</tt>:</p>\n\n<pre>[(Hack *)object hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>You could also drop down to the runtime level and do an explicit cast:</p>\n\n<pre>((id (*)(id, SEL, id))objc_msgSend)(object, @selector(hasPrefix:), @&quot;foo&quot;);</pre>\n\n<p>Now let&apos;s look at the assembly code generated by the above line:</p>\n\n<pre>leal LC1-&quot;L00000000001$pb&quot;(%ebx), %edx\nleal L_OBJC_SELECTOR_REFERENCES_0-&quot;L00000000001$pb&quot;(%ebx), %eax\nmovl (%eax), %eax\nmovl %edx, 8(%esp)\nmovl %eax, 4(%esp)\nmovl -16(%ebp), %eax\nmovl %eax, (%esp)\ncall L_objc_msgSend$stub     ; the preparation in the lead-up to the message send is identical\nmovl %eax, -12(%ebp)         ; id return: get return value from %eax (4 bytes in size)</pre>\n\n<p>Compare that with the assembly generated for the <tt>BOOL</tt> return case:</p>\n\n<pre>leal LC1-&quot;L00000000001$pb&quot;(%ebx), %edx\nleal L_OBJC_SELECTOR_REFERENCES_0-&quot;L00000000001$pb&quot;(%ebx), %eax\nmovl (%eax), %eax\nmovl %edx, 8(%esp)\nmovl %eax, 4(%esp)\nmovl -16(%ebp), %eax\nmovl %eax, (%esp)\ncall L_objc_msgSend$stub     ; the preparation in the lead-up to the message send is identical\nmovb %al, -9(%ebp)           ; BOOL return: get return value from %al (1 byte in size)</pre>\n\n<p>This is why merely casting is never going to be enough to solve this problem: the low-level ABI returns different kinds of results in different ways. Fortunately, the ABI itself is <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/LowLevelABI/LowLevelABI.pdf\">very well documented</a>, and we may need to get our hands dirty with it before the end of this article.</p>\n\n<h4>Exploring the possible solutions</h4>\n\n<p>We&apos;ve seen two workarounds already above: one is declaring &quot;hack&quot; interfaces and then casting to them (you could define macros to make this easier if you think it&apos;s going to be something that you do often); another is using casting in conjunction with <tt>objc_msgSend</tt>.</p>\n\n<p>But which would you rather use?</p>\n\n<pre>[[object select] hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];\n((id (*)(id, SEL, id))objc_msgSend)(object, @selector(hasPrefix:), @&quot;foo&quot;);</pre>\n\n<p>The whole point of HOM is making your intention as transparent and easy-to-express as possible. It might be possible to make the cast a little less ugly using a macro definition:</p>\n\n<pre>#define WO_SELECT(object, sel, ...) \\\n((id (*)(id, SEL, id))objc_msgSend)(objc_msgSend(object, @selector(select)), sel, __VA_ARGS__);</pre>\n\n<p>Which would mean that you could write...</p>\n\n<pre>WO_SELECT(object, @selector(hasPrefix:), @&quot;foo&quot;);</pre>\n\n<p>... which is marginally better but still far from desirable, and even further from the the ideal of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/11/hom_update.php\">true HOM</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>The underscore trick</h4>\n\n<p>I believe that <a href=\"http://www.metaobject.com/Research.html\">MPWFoundation</a> provides a hack which programmers can use to avoid the unwanted compiler mangling; the details run something like this:</p>\n\n<pre>[[object select] __hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>Anything beginning with two consecutive underscores will be caught by the trampoline, the underscores removed, and the real message sent. MPWFoundation provides a number of predefined &quot;hack&quot; interface declarations for methods such as <tt>__isKindOfClass:</tt> to avoid compiler warnings. If you try this trick with any method for which a corresponding interface declaration does not exist then you&apos;ll get this warning:</p>\n\n<pre>warning: no &#x2018;-__hasPrefix:&#x2019; method found\nwarning: (Messages without a matching method signature\nwarning: will be assumed to return &#x2018;id&#x2019; and accept\nwarning: &#x2018;...&#x2019; as arguments.)</pre>\n\n<p>If you go down this path you may find it useful to define a macro:</p>\n\n<pre>#define WO_MACRO_HACK(selector) __ # selector</pre>\n\n<p>Which would be used as such:</p>\n\n<pre>[[object select] WO_UNDERSCORE_HACK(hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;)];</pre>\n\n<p>But it is debatable whether this looks any better or is more useful than the alternative.</p>\n\n<h4>The inline assembly trick</h4>\n\n<p>Ofri Wolfus&apos; <a href=\"http://www.dpompa.com/?p=33\">HOM implementation</a> takes an alternative tack. First <a href=\"http://svn.dpompa.com/hom/trunk/Source/HOMMacros.h\">he defines</a> an <tt>ID</tt> macro as follows (for Intel):</p>\n\n<pre>#define ID(X...) ({ volatile id __o = nil; X; asm volatile (&quot;mov %%eax, %0&quot;: &quot;=m&quot; (__o)); __o; })</pre>\n\n<p>Message objects are then created using <a href=\"http://svn.dpompa.com/hom/trunk/Source/Classes/Message.h\">the <tt>MSG</tt> macro</a>:</p>\n\n<pre>#define MSG(X...) ID([_sharedMessageBuilder X])</pre>\n\n<p>So the following:</p>\n\n<pre>[array select:MSG(hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;)];</pre>\n\n<p>After preprocessing evaluates to:</p>\n\n<pre>[array select:({ volatile id __o = 0; [_sharedMessageBuilder hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;]; asm volatile (&quot;mov %%eax, %0&quot;: &quot;=m&quot; (__o)); __o; })];</pre>\n\n<p>As our assembly excerpt above shows, the compiler will see the <tt>hasPrefix:</tt> message and output the following assembly language:</p>\n\n<pre>call L_objc_msgSend$stub\nmovb %al, -9(%ebp)</pre>\n\n<p>But what we wanted was:</p>\n\n<pre>call L_objc_msgSend$stub\nmovl %eax, -12(%ebp)</pre>\n\n<p>So if we re-write the above code block using a mixed Objective-C/assembly notation we get:</p>\n\n<pre>{\n    volatile id __o = 0; \n    [_sharedMessageBuilder hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];   // compiler thinks that return value is in %al\n    asm volatile (&quot;mov %%eax, %0&quot;: &quot;=m&quot; (__o)); // move real return value from %eax to __o\n    __o;                                        // evaluate __o: __o will effectively be passed to select:\n}</pre>\n\n<p>Although this may seem terribly hackish, the ABI itself is quite well documented so there&apos;s only a small amount of &quot;black magic&quot; going on here. It&apos;s not too difficult to imagine using the <tt>ID</tt> macro in a more conventional HOM implementation with only a slight readability penalty:</p>\n\n<pre>ID([[collection select] hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;])</pre>\n\n<p>The downside of using such macros is that due to their low-level nature it requires four variations to be written, maintained and tested (32 and 64 bit variants for PowerPC, likewise for 32 and 64 bit Intel) and if Apple ever changes the ABI in a significant way then they must be updated.</p>\n\n<h4>An alternative macro approach</h4>\n\n<p>The Cocoade frameworks (<a href=\"http://www.cocoade.com/products/frameworks/Documentation/index.html\">documented here</a>) do a different macro trick, using a <tt>HOM</tt> macro and <tt>hom_t</tt> type to leverage some GCC built-in functions:</p>\n\n<pre>typedef union { long l; unsigned long ul; long long ll; \nunsigned long long ull; float f; double d; void *v;\nid o; } hom_t;\n<br>\n#define HOM(X) \\\n((hom_t) \\\n__builtin_choose_expr(\\\n__builtin_types_compatible_p(__typeof__(X), float),(__typeof__(X)) X, \\\n__builtin_choose_expr(\\\n__builtin_types_compatible_p(__typeof__(X), double),(__typeof__(X)) X, \\\n__builtin_choose_expr(\\\nsizeof(__typeof__(X)) <= sizeof(long),(long)=\"\" x,=\"\" (__typeof__(x))=\"\" x=\"\" )))).o<=\"\" pre=\"\">\n\n<p>This macro depends on GCC&apos;s <tt>__builtin_choose_expr</tt> and <tt>__builtin_types_compatible_p</tt> functions, documented <a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.0.3/gcc/Other-Builtins.html#Other-Builtins\">here</a>. Expressed in &quot;pseudo code&quot; the <tt>HOM</tt> macro does the following with the expression, <tt>X</tt>:</p>\n\n<pre>if (type of X is float or compatible)\n    return (float)X;\nelse\n{\n    if (type of X is double or compatible)\n        return (double)X;\n    else\n    {\n        if (size of type of X <= size=\"\" of=\"\" long=\"\" type)=\"\" return=\"\" (long)x;=\"\" }=\"\" (type=\"\" x)x;<=\"\" pre=\"\">\n\n<p>The &quot;returned&quot; value in the pseudo-code above is used to populate the appropriate field of a <tt>hom_t</tt> union, and the <tt>o</tt> field of that union is then evaluated, effectively casting to <tt>id</tt> (the type of <tt>o</tt>).</p>\n\n<p>I don&apos;t have access to the Cocoade source code, only the public headers, but based on my analysis of this macro I can&apos;t see how it would solve the problem at issue here. The macro is effectively a fancy cast to <tt>id</tt> that you can use without provoking any &quot;cast to pointer from integer of different size&quot; warnings, but it doesn&apos;t seem to address the underlying problem that the compiler will still trash the <tt>id</tt> return value wherever it thinks it is a <tt>BOOL</tt>.</p>\n\n<h4>Changing GCC</h4>\n\n<p>The notes that come with MPWFoundation state, &quot;The current compiler generates code for the BOOL return it thinks is happening that mangles the id-return that is actually happening.  A patch has been submitted to the gcc Objective-C maintainer&quot;. I haven&apos;t been able to find any other public details about this, but I imagine it modifies the way that BOOLs are returned so that they are returned in the same way that normal integers are (in EAX in the case of Intel chips). If accepted, it will probably be quite a while before such a patch makes trickles down into the version of GCC that ships with Apple&apos;s Xcode tools. I&apos;m not all that hopeful, to tell the truth, because if this patch involves any ABI changes then its chances of being accepted are very slim indeed; but given that the patch isn&apos;t public it&apos;s hard to say...</p>\n\n<h4>Twisted workarounds</h4>\n\n<p>Thinking about other ways to tackle this problem leads one down a path in which the workarounds get successively twisted and lead one further and further away from the ideal (transparent intentions, minimal obstacles to expressing those intentions).</p>\n\n<p>For example...</p>\n\n<pre>// desired ideal form, but with fatal flaw\n[[collection select] hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];\n<br>\n// could you interpose something there that made the compiler think that an id was returned?\n[[collection select] method_that_returns_id_and_accepts_bool:[thing hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>So what is the &quot;<tt>method_that_returns_id_and_accepts_bool</tt>&quot;? <tt>select</tt> can return a proxy or some other kind of object responds to the &quot;<tt>method_that_returns_id_and_accepts_bool</tt>&quot; message. But what then is the &quot;<tt>thing</tt>&quot; object referred to above? Evidently it must be something that somehow records a message send and returns a boolean.</p>\n\n<p>But the &quot;<tt>thing</tt>&quot; object has no idea what kind of message it is going to have to record, doesn&apos;t know what object it is standing in for (because it doesn&apos;t know what kind of collection <tt>select</tt> was sent to) and so it will be difficult for it to obtain a proper method signature in a bullet-proof fashion. Also, given that it only returns a <tt>BOOL</tt>, it can&apos;t really communicate anything useful back to the &quot;<tt>method_that_returns_id_and_accepts_bool</tt>&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>This leads you inevitably towards the following type of construct:</p>\n\n<pre>// need some way of letting the &quot;catcher&quot; know what kind of object it is standing in for\ncatcher = [BoolCatcherMaker catcherForObject:collecton];\n<br>\n// and need some kind of way to tell a collection to select on the basis of what the catcher says\n[[collection selectWithBoolCatcher:catcher] hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];\n<br>\n// the return value can&apos;t be trusted, must query the catcher\n[catcher selection];</pre>\n\n<p>And no matter how you try to formulate things you will always come up with a construct of three lines; there&apos;s no way to do it as a one-liner. This is for the simple reason that you can&apos;t trust the return value after sending the <tt>hasPrefix:</tt> message. You therefore need to query the proxy afterwards in a separate message send (requiring 2 lines). And in order to query the proxy you need to grab a reference to it first (now we&apos;re up to 3 lines).</p>\n\n<p>That is, the pattern is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Get the proxy, keeping a reference to it</li>\n<li>Send the message to the proxy (and let the proxy do its work)</li>\n<li>Query the proxy for the results</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So the simple:</p>\n\n<pre>[[collection select] hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>Has morphed into:</p>\n\n<pre>WOHOMSelector *selector = [WOHOMSelector selectorForObject:object];\n(void)[selector hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];\nNSArray *selection = [object select:selector];</pre>\n\n<p>And in doing this you practically lose the entire benefit of HOM. If that&apos;s the best you can do then you may as well just write stuff using <tt>NSPredicate</tt> objects:</p>\n\n<pre>[array filteredArrayUsingPredicate:[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@&quot;hasSalary == %d&quot;, 1000]];</pre>\n\n<p>The only shortcoming of this approach is that the <tt>NSPredicate</tt> class is 10.4+ only, and it is incapable of expressing constructs like this one:</p>\n\n<pre>[[array select] hasPrefix:[prefixes each]];</pre>\n\n<p>There is one way in which we could reduce our hackish three-line HOM construct to two lines, and that would be to add a method to store the last result and then later retrieve it:</p>\n\n<pre>(void)[[WOHOMSelector selectorForObject:object] hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];   // can&apos;t depend on return value\nNSArray *selection = [WOHOMSelector lastSelection];</pre>\n\n<p>To make this thread-safe would require the use of thread-local storage, and thread-local storage is quite slow, unfortunately. Adding that to the already considerable overhead of trampoline-based HOM makes it quite unattractive.</p>\n\n<h4>Concluding comments</h4>\n\n<p>&quot;The <tt>BOOL</tt> return problem&quot; is such a big deal that <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/chomp-mac\">some HOM implementors</a> have <a href=\"http://chomp-mac.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/chomp-mac/chomp/HACKING?revision=1.1.1.1\">elected to omit</a> some of the most important and useful HOM selectors (&quot;select&quot; and &quot;reject&quot;):</p>\n\n<blockquote>One unfortunate consequence of these goals is that certain HOMs become difficult or impossible to implement. The classic filter messages, -select and -reject, cannot be implemented in a simple, portable manner because the messages given to them typically return BOOL, but the HOM needs to return an object. This could be at least partially rectified by writing filter messages which only act on mutable containers and don&apos;t return anything, but this is less than ideal.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of all the possible solutions, the Wolfus (<tt>ID</tt>) macro-based solution seems to be the best of a bad bunch, and it is a macro-based solution that I went with when I <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2006/11/wocommon_r179_11_items_changed.php\">checked in</a> my own &quot;select&quot; implementation yesterday.</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s probably worth reminding ourselves why we care about all this anyway. The kind of HOM pattern that we can easily implement without kludges (the &quot;collect&quot; pattern) is exactly the kind of pattern we could do faster using normal Cocoa calls:</p>\n\n<pre>// this is the HOM collect\n[[collection collect] foobar];\n<br>\n// and this is the Cocoa equivalent for NSArray\n[collection valueForKey:@&quot;foobar&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>The Cocoa version wins on speed, is only a few characters longer, and works on 10.3 and up. The HOM version may lose a bit on speed (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/11/hom_update.php\">depending on the number of elements in the array</a>), wins the character count contest by a few chars, and (depending on the implementation) can work on any version of Mac OS X and with any kind of collection object (not just NSArray); my implementation goes a step further and works with any object at all.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of clarity of intention it&apos;s probably a tie. The HOM alternative is highly readable to anyone familiar with HOM. Other programmers may need a clarifying comment. The Cocoa version looks extremely readable at first glance but it requires a constant string key instead of a bare selector and its operation may not be immediately evident; a &quot;value for key&quot; method might suggest to some that a single element is being returned, not an array containing the values for the key of the objects in the receiver.</p>\n\n<p>But there are two things you can do in the HOM pattern that you cannot do in the standard Cocoa version and they are pass parameters:</p>\n\n<pre>[[collection collect] hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>And iterate over collection members and arguments in &quot;lock step&quot;:</p>\n\n<pre>[[collection collect] foobar:[keywords elements]];</pre>\n\n<p>And that&apos;s why people jump through so many hoops so that they can drag the &quot;select&quot; and &quot;select where&quot; HOMs, kicking and screaming, into Objective-C; so that they can write stuff like this:</p>\n\n<pre>return [[collection selectWhere] plugInIdentifier] isEqualToString:[desiredIdentifiers elements]];</pre>\n\n<p>Instead of this:</p>\n\n<pre>NSEnumerator *enumerator = [collection objectEnumerator];\nid item;\nunsigned counter = 0;\nNSMutableArray *results = [NSMutableArray array];\nwhile ((item = [enumerator nextObject]))\n{\n    if ([[item plugInIdentifier] isEqualToString:[desiredElements objectAtIndex:counter++]])\n        [results addObject:item];\n}\nreturn [[array copy] autorelease];</pre>\n</=></pre></=></pre></div></div>",

A handy replacement for the <tt>load</tt> method in categories with a better-defined execution order from which you can safely call methods in super classes and other classes.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, it&apos;s not entirely safe to send <em>any</em> Objective-C message from inside <tt>load</tt> because there are no guarantees. In practice, on the current version of Mac OS X, it is safe to send messages to your superclass because the runtime will load them and <tt>initialize</tt> them for you if necessary, but that could change with any future version of the OS. Likewise I&apos;ve never had a problem sending messages to Cocoa classes from inside <tt>load</tt> but that could change too.</p>\n\n<p>So the module-level constructors and destructors are a welcome solution.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000932more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>One of the things which tricked me when I <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2006/11/wocommon_r165_8_items_changed.php\">first started</a> with <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/hom/\">HOM</a> (an entire 6 days ago) was that I would see examples like this:</p>\n\n<pre>[[collection select] hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>And assumed that I could write things like:</p>\n\n<pre>[[[collection select] stringValue] hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>It turns out that you have to write this:</p>\n\n<pre>[[[collection selectWhere] stringValue] hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>This is an unfortunate breakdown of a couple of the key principles that underlie HOM: &quot;think about intentions, don&apos;t get distracted by implementation details&quot;, and &quot;make your intentions clear&quot;. You have to worry about two different HOM patterns &quot;select&quot; and &quot;select where&quot; for what is essentially exactly the same operation: selecting items from a collection based on a yes/no criteria. You have one variation which consists of a prefix message followed by an argument message, and you have another that consists of a prefix message followed by two argument messages.</p>\n\n<p>In my implementation of this pattern that means having one class for handling the first variation (<tt>WOHOMSelectProxy</tt>) and another pair of classes for handling the second one (<tt>WOHOMSelectWhereProxy</tt> and <tt>WOHOMWhereProxy</tt>). This works but you&apos;re probably wondering what you do if you ever want to send more than two argument messages... (And yes, I&apos;ve chosen to use different classes for different types of trampoline behaviour; this allows me to keep my source files shorter and more manageable, group my unit tests into smaller, more manageable groups, and import <em>only</em> the HOM functionality that I am interested in for any given project rather than having to link to a gigantic framework.)</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000934more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>So last night it occurred to me that this distinction between the two variations was unnecessary. I&apos;ve <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2006/11/wocommon_r186_14_items_changed.php\">just checked in</a> a new HOM class, <tt>WOHOMChainedSelectProxy</tt>, that allows you to use a single HOM regardless of whether you&apos;re doing a straight &quot;select&quot; or a &quot;select where&quot;. It&apos;s &quot;chained&quot; because you can chain as many levels together as you want: one, two, three, four, the sky is the (non-arbitrary) limit. In other words, all of the following work:</p>\n\n<pre>\n[[collection select] hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];\n[[[collection select] stringValue] hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];\n[[[[collection select] stringValue] uppercaseString] hasPrefix:@&quot;FOO&quot;];\n[[[[[collection select] stringValue] uppercaseString] substringWithRange:NSMakeRange(2, 3)] isEqualToString:@&quot;FOO&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>Don&apos;t ask me <em>why</em> you&apos;d ever want to nest things that deeply; the important thing is that you <em>can</em> if you want to. Just as Objective-C allows (and even encourages) you to nest message sends, and key-value coding allows you to create path chains by writing things like @&quot;stringValue.lowercaseString&quot;, and Objective-C 2.0 will feature a property syntax that allows you to chain your property accesses by writing things like <tt>stringValue.length</tt>, I think HOM should allow you to do the same too when you want.</p>\n\n<p>Previously the only way to hack this kind of arbitrarily long chain together would be to mix in &quot;collect&quot; messages between your other argument messages, which would be terribly inefficient, terribly ugly, and terribly cumbersome, thus throwing the whole simplifying purpose of HOM out the window:</p>\n\n<pre>[[[[[[[[collection collect] stringValue] collect] uppercaseString] collect] substringWithRange:NSMakeRange(2, 3)] select] isEqualToString:@&quot;FOO&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>Apart from ridding us of an arbitrary distinction and accompanying limitation, the new code addresses the concerns about getting distracted by implementation details. Don&apos;t think about using &quot;select&quot; or &quot;select where&quot;, just go ahead an use &quot;select&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>All of this comes at a very small performance cost. I&apos;ll shortly post an article with some numbers to back this up, but I believe that the single-level select (equivalent to the old &quot;select&quot; HOM) and the two-level select (equivalent to the old &quot;select where&quot; HOM) will be basically the same. Once you start nesting more deeply your set-up costs will go up but there are generally up-front costs and once the iteration has begun things will go relatively quickly. If you find that you have to nest too deeply and the speed is a problem then it is probably a hint that your design is bad; it&apos;s hard to think of too many cases where you would want to chain to more than two levels.</p>\n\n<p>The new pattern eliminates one of the areas in which the <tt>valueForKey:</tt> method in the <tt>NSArray</tt> class had the edge. Previously, if you wanted to chain together multiple levels using the &quot;select where&quot; HOM you had to engage in this kind of kludgery:</p>\n\n<pre>[[[collection selectWhere] valueForKey:@&quot;stringValue.lowercaseString&quot;] isEqualToString:@&quot;foo&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>Now you can just write:</p>\n\n<pre>[[[[collection select] stringValue] lowercaseString] isEqualToString:@&quot;foo&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>And you can do something that was never possible using <tt>valueForKey:</tt> &#x2014; pass parameters to the argument messages in the chain:</p>\n\n<pre>[[[[collection select] stringValue] substringFromIndex:3] isEqualToString:@&quot;bar&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>It&apos;s also interesting to compare the syntax for chaining argument messages used here with <a href=\"http://www.dpompa.com/?p=33\">the syntax</a> you&apos;d need to use if you were using <a href=\"http://www.dpompa.com/?page_id=4\">Ofri Wolfus&apos; HOM implementation</a>:</p>\n\n<pre>// this version should be instantly readable to most Objective-C programmers\n[[[[collection select] capitalizedString] lastPathComponent] hasPrefix:@&quot;a&quot;];\n<br>\n// this the Wolfus version of the same:\n[collection selectWhere:MSG(capitalizedString), MSG(lastPathComponent), MSG(hasPrefix:@&quot;a&quot;), nil];</pre>\n\n<h4>Concluding comments</h4>\n\n<p>This definitely isn&apos;t the only &quot;select&quot; HOM that you&apos;ll ever need. There is still a strong justification for <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2006/11/wocommon_r184_23_items_changed.php\">a &quot;select first&quot; HOM</a>, for example, because such a HOM is more efficient: rather than iterating of the entire collection it can stop and immediately return as soon as it finds the desired element. It can also explicitly return a single object rather than wrapping the found item up in a single-item array:</p>\n\n<pre>// the &quot;select first&quot; version\nid item = [[collection selectFirst] hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];\n<br>\n// the alternative is slower and less convenient\nNSArray *collection = [[collection select] hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;];\nid item = [collection count] &gt; 0 ? [collection objectAtIndex:0] : nil;\n<br>\n// even if you define a &quot;firstObject&quot; method this is still less efficient:\nid item = [[[collection select] hasPrefix:@&quot;foo&quot;] firstObject];</pre>\n\n<p>The implementation could fairly easily be extended to the &quot;collect&quot; HOM as well (and others for that matter...) but with one important difference: such a &quot;collect&quot; HOM would need an a &quot;suffix message&quot; to serve as an end marker:</p>\n\n<pre>[[[[collection collect] stringValue] lastPathComponent] endCollect];</pre>\n\n<p>This is because in the case of the &quot;collect&quot; HOM all argument messages effectively look alike; there is no way to automatically tell which is the final argument message in the chain. In many cases using the built-in alternative will be faster and more concise anyway:</p>\n\n<pre>[collection valueForKey:@&quot;stringValue.lastPathComponent&quot;];</pre>\n\n<p>The only case where the HOM &quot;collect&quot; pattern is necessary is where you must pass arguments along with your argument messages. An (admittedly ugly) workaround enabling you to chain &quot;collect&quot; operations together is to interpolate as follows:</p>\n\n<pre>[[[[collection collect] stringValue] collect] lastPathComponent];</pre>\n\n<p>But my policy with respect to implementing new HOM patterns at the moment is that I don&apos;t bother touching them until I actually run into a real-world case where I need the new pattern. HOM is basically an open-ended playground in which you could waste a lot of time building sand castles, so I&apos;m carefully keeping only to stuff that I actually need/want to use.</p>\n\n<p>Performance numbers on the code described in this post <a href=\"http://colaiuta.net/\">coming soon</a>.</p>\n</div></div>",

The &quot;chained&quot; HOM version loses its edge with respect to the &quot;unchained&quot; version but the difference never grows beyond a factor of two at the first level of nesting and the difference diminishes at the second level of nesting. At the third and fourth levels of nesting the &quot;unchained&quot; HOM can&apos;t be used.</p>\n\n<p>Relative to the non-HOM pattern, the &quot;chained&quot; HOM has a relative speed of about 414% at the first level, 245% at the second level, 232% at the third level and 226% at the fourth and final level tested (where &quot;relative speed&quot; is to how long it takes to complete). So as the level of nesting grows the performance penalty associated with HOM is gradually reduced. The cost of chaining is as follows: if first level chaining is 100%, then second-level costs 598%, third-level costs 769% and fourth-level costs 872%. In other words, chaining imposes a considerable cost up front to go from first-level to second-level, but subsequently levels after that have a relatively constant cost.</p>\n\n<p>As expected, the &quot;select first&quot; HOM is faster than the equivalent code written using a normal &quot;select&quot; HOM. In the tests the desired result was planted in the test array exactly half-way through, so the speed difference of two-times is as one would expect.</p>\n\n<h4>Concluding statements</h4>\n\n<p>These are only preliminary figures but they do give a rough idea of the performance of an unoptimized HOM implementation. Even the worst case scenarios don&apos;t look too bad for most uses, so I don&apos;t think there&apos;ll be any need to optimize the implementation until (and if) specific problem areas are discovered with Apple&apos;s profiling tools.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Sometimes you are working on a thorny coding problem and find yourself feeling less and less happy with the number of kludgey hacks you&apos;re having to implement in order to get things working. Then comes a &quot;duh!&quot; moment in which you realize that there is a better way that avoids all of the kludges, is much cleaner, and works. It&apos;s usually blindingly obvious once you see it.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a000974more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>The most recent case of this was only yesterday when I was working on setting up a kind of client-server communications channel between the main <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> application and a helper. It&apos;s thorny because you don&apos;t necessarily know which one will be launched first and so when trying to set up a inter-application communication mechanism you need to include code for launching the app at other side of the link, waiting for it to get ready, and actually setting up the link. You also have to worry about race conditions (the time between checking if something is running and the trying to launch it).</p>\n\n<p>So you solve the race condition by trying to launch it unconditionally using a method that will not spawn a second copy of the application if another one is already running.</p>\n\n<p>That leaves the &quot;waiting for the other side to be ready&quot; problem. Polling sucks, but you can&apos;t use <tt>NSWorkspace</tt> notifications for background processes so you have to look for another means. About the most elegant non-polling solution I could come up with was to use the <tt>kqueue</tt> mechanism to monitor the <tt>windowserver</tt> for forks and use that as a trigger to scan for new processes.</p>\n\n<p>This won&apos;t work on Tiger, however, due to a kernel-panic inducing bug that Apple introduced in 10.4, which I thankfully already knew about before even trying because I had seen it in a mailing list archive.</p>\n\n<p>So there I was in that sticky place where things are starting to look very ugly. I tried to encapsulate the ugliness of polling inside a <tt>WOProcessLauncher</tt> class with the idea being that once Apple fixed the panic bug I could switch the underlying mechanism over to the non-polling version. But I wasn&apos;t happy with that even though it worked.</p>\n\n<p>Then I had my &quot;duh!&quot; moment while I popped out to buy the bread for the day. Luckily I had only spent about one hour crafting the kludge. A classic case of not seeing the wood for the trees, my brain had started off so impregnated with the &quot;request notification, don&apos;t poll&quot; mentality that I hadn&apos;t seen the most obvious and elegant implementation. The appropriate sequence is not:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Launch helper</li>\n<li>Wait for it to finish launching</li>\n<li>Try setting up link</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>But instead I had to throw the client-server distinction out the window and think of the two apps as peers and use the following sequence:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Launch peer</li>\n<li>Peer notifies when it has finished launching</li>\n<li>Set up link</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I hadn&apos;t thought of this because my initial boxed-in thinking had me thinking of the helper as a server and the main app as a client, and that implied a one-way communication channel in which the main app would send commands to the server but the server wouldn&apos;t send anything back. As soon as I realized that they should be peers I saw that there was no reason why the link shouldn&apos;t be two-way and that either peer could initiate communication with the other and saying &quot;I&apos;m ready!&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Of course I should have realized this immediately but that&apos;s what programming is all about: a learning process in which through experience you increase your arsenal of possible designs, learning which ones suck and which ones don&apos;t, and getting better at recognizing when to use which tool.</p>\n</div></div>",

Only this did:</p>\n\n<pre>digit = digit - &apos;a&apos; + 10;</pre>\n\n<p>Operator precedence strikes again. The two forms are not equivalent, because the former is actually equivalent to:</p>\n\n<pre>digit -= (&apos;a&apos; + 10);</pre>\n\n<p>Which in turn gives us:</p>\n\n<pre>digit = digit - (&apos;a&apos; + 10);</pre>\n\n<p>Which in turn is equivalent to:</p>\n\n<pre>digit = digit - &apos;a&apos; - 10;</pre>\n\n<p>Which clearly isn&apos;t the same as:</p>\n\n<pre>digit = digit - &apos;a&apos; + 10;</pre>\n\n<p>So anyway, I think it&apos;s an interesting example of how a programmer&apos;s natural tendency to prefer shorter expressions, combined with an iterative development model, combined with C&apos;s operator precedence rules, can lead you down a path where your code doesn&apos;t work like you think it should. </p>\n\n<p>I am unlikely to make the same mistake again in the future, but I am almost certain to make a different-but-related mistake at some point. Which of course leads us back to the fact that unit testing is essential part of any decent development process.</p>\n</div></div>",

At fifty cents a pop you&apos;d have made a quick five or six grand, but you&apos;d have done so only by selling your product at a 80 or 90% discount, and then you have to provide customer service, technical support, and all the rest for literally thousands of new customers.</p>\n\n<p>If you&apos;re a one-man shop like I am you&apos;re likely to spend all your time communicating with customers and no time at all working on your products in the weeks immediately after the aptly-named heist, and you wouldn&apos;t have to spend too long on each support transaction to nullify the benefit of the 50 cents you made selling the license. In the mean time, if Gruber&apos;s calculations are correct, the organizers and not the developers walk off with a cool half-a-million dollars in their pockets.</p>\n\n<p>Those developers who participated have lost in the short term, in my opinion. In the long term they <i>might</i> come out in front, but only if the &quot;mindspace&quot; that they&apos;ve earned in this show lasts for long enough for them to get some full-price sales out of it.</p>\n\n<p>If the organizers had approached me to participate I would have thought about it. The numbers in my case are not as scandalous seeing as <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">Synergy</a> only costs 5&#x20AC; anyway, but if I was selling a higher-priced app like TextMate (which currently goes for 39&#x20AC;) there&apos;s no way I would&apos;ve participated, not in a million years.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001058more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

Also, the switch to map tables permitted the use of NSMapInsertKnownAbsent which in turn revealed that the sharedInstance and allocWithZone methods were both trying to add the same entry to the singleton registry; this was harmless but redundant so one of the redundant calls has been removed.</p>",

    "html": "<p>With every major release of Mac OS X Apple delivers some delicious new APIs to developers. I&apos;ve missed out on these a lot in the past because I&apos;ve wanted my products to support older versions of Mac OS X. It&apos;s true that you can employ a number of tricks like weak linking to make your software run on multiple OS versions, but the complexity of your code increases as does the difficulty of adequately testing it. <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">Synergy</a>, for example, began development on Jaguar back in 2002 and it doesn&apos;t make use of any post-10.2 API.</p>\n\n<p>Products that I released later on, such as <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> take advantage of newer APIs found in Panther (Cocoa Bindings, for example). But I&apos;ve still tended to keep things at the level of the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot;, and when Tiger came out I still tried to use only APIs that were available on Panther as well.</p>\n\n<p>But it&apos;s a game I don&apos;t want to play any more. Avoiding the newer APIs is literally holding these products back. Time to make the jump forwards. The update to Synergy Advance that I am currently working on makes use of Tiger-only APIs and I&apos;ve bumped the version requirement up from 10.3.9 to 10.4. In 2007 I plan to switch to pretty much Leopard-only development.</p>\n\n<p>In recent months I&apos;ve been making new plug-ins for Synergy Advance and some of these used 10.4-only features like <tt>NSDatePicker</tt> and <tt>NSTreeController</tt> (which <em>so</em> should have been rolled out with the other Cocoa Bindings stuff in 10.3): but being plug-ins it didn&apos;t really matter if they broke compatibility; they could just refuse to load on older versions of the operating system.</p>\n\n<p>The first 10.4-only API to sneak into the core application was the Apple System Log facility (see <tt>man asl</tt>). In fact, I started to make some changes and it was only after committing them that I realized that they depended on Tiger. Now ASL is not a very glamorous API, but it is a useful one, and it has opened the flood gates to using Tiger APIs.</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve been doing a huge amount of restructuring of the Dock icon code in preparation for Leopard and so I thought, why not learn Core Image while I&apos;m at it? On Sunday I <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2006/12/wocommon_r243_8_items_changed.php\">committed</a> my first Core Image code to the repository.</p>\n\n<p>Once that little experiment proved successful I set about replacing all of the Cocoa compositing code with Core Image. Given that Core Image is more powerful I took the opportunity to not just translate the code to the new API but to improve the image quality as well; for example, instead of just resizing I now resize and sharpen. I just <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2006/12/synergy_advance_r377_16_items.php\">committed</a> the initial results. I was pleasantly surprised that after those massive, disruptive, non-incremental changes, the code compiled and worked pretty much as I would have expected to on the first try.</p>\n\n<p>And it&apos;s quite fun to use the Core Image API. The code tends to be more verbose than the old Cocoa version because there is a fair bit of set-up and tear-down to be done with the filters. But the design itself feels very elegant and very Object-Oriented. The filters are like little black boxes: you plug-in the inputs, chain as many filters as you want together, and then ask for the result. One of the reasons it feels so elegant is that the use of Key-Value Coding gives the API a very consistent feel. The other is that the whole thing is extremely efficient just by design: even though you spend time setting up and tearing down the filters, the actually expensive part of the whole operation (the rendering) is deferred until the time to actually draw the image arrives.</p>\n\n<p>So here are some unscientific demonstration images; first of all we have a picture of the Dock icon as it was about one week ago. You can see that it&apos;s a little different than the icon in the currently-shipping preview of Synergy Advance because at this point, prior to embarking on the Core Image rewrite, I had already started to add user preferences for altering the opacity of the cover art badge and the colors of the various elements in the icon:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"SADockBefore.png\" src=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/SADockBefore.png\" width=\"263\" height=\"170\"></p>\n\n<p>Here is a similar image made after the Core Image rewrite; like I said not very scientific but you may be able to detect the improved image quality that results from the superior Core Image scaling and the additional sharpening step.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"SADockAfter.png\" src=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/SADockAfter.png\" width=\"184\" height=\"160\"></p>\n\n<p>Performance is roughly equivalent despite the additional processing. In doing the rewrite I also took the opportunity to refactor the code, splitting common code off into methods and throwing out a huge bunch of fairly verbose and complicated caching and optimizations that I had made to the old Cocoa version in an effort to get it as fast as possible. The new code is completely unoptimized yet Core Image still manages to maintain performance levels. The refactoring should enable me to put a preview icon right in the preferences window at full size so that users can get a better idea of the effects of their customizations; this is important because there are a large number of new settings.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it&apos;s not perfect. As shown in the image below the code for handling cover art badges doesn&apos;t yet handle non-square album art. Should be quick enough to fix.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"SADockBug.png\" src=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/SADockBug.png\" width=\"224\" height=\"173\"></p>\n\n<div id=\"a001095more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

Today I was waiting for a compile to finish and was wishing a friend a merry Christmas over IM when I noticed that my keypresses weren&apos;t resulting in any output. Mouseclicks didn&apos;t work either although I could still move the pointer. Mousing over the Dock yielded nothing. Yet iTunes continued to play and the seconds on the clock continued to update smoothly.</p>\n\n<p>I patiently waited for iTunes to finish playing tracks. Mac OS X rarely hard crashes anymore, but it can still make itself unusable by running out of Mach ports for instance. But playback of the next track started fine and that indicated new files could be opened and that port exhaustion was most likely not the problem. I tried clicking. Typing. Turning the wireless Mighty Mouse off and on again (in fact, earlier today I had lost the ability to click again although mouse movement still worked and that was cured by power cycling the mouse). I don&apos;t have another machine here so I couldn&apos;t try connecting via SSH. I couldn&apos;t bring up the &quot;Force Quit&quot; dialog either, nor the application switcher.</p>\n\n<p>The screen saver kicked in and ran as slow as treacle. Couldn&apos;t escape from it by moving the mouse, clicking or typing. I hit the power button: nothing. Again, the machine finally decided to go to sleep. Bash the keyboard and click the mouse until the machine woke up. After a minute or two of clomping the keyboard the screensaver finally snapped back to normal performance levels and I was able to get back to the desktop again. I tried plugging in a wired mouse: no difference, still couldn&apos;t click.</p>\n\n<p>So held the power button and did a hard reset. There was no unsaved work but I hate losing all my open applications and windows (dozens of them) and knowing that my Mail application has probably left my 5 gigabyte mail folder in an inconsistent state.</p>\n\n<p>As per standard procedure, booted off the Mac OS X DVD to run Disk First Aid; no problems reported.</p>\n\n<h4>Involuntary reboot stats to date</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Operating system version:</strong> 10.4.8</li>\n<li><strong>Kernel panics:</strong> 6</li>\n<li><strong>Hard resets:</strong> 1</li>\n<li><strong>Total failures:</strong> 7</li>\n<li><strong>Start of recording keeping:</strong> 21 May 2006</li>\n<li><strong>Total days to date:</strong> 222 days</li>\n<li><strong>Average time between failures:</strong> 31 days</li>\n<li><strong>Uptime at moment of failure(s):</strong> Several days</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As per usual I used the interactive Ruby interpreter, <tt>irb</tt>, to do the date calculations for me:</p>\n\n<pre>require &apos;date&apos;\ntoday = Date.today\nstart = Date.new(2006, 5, 21)\ntoday - start\n222 / 7</pre>\n\n<div id=\"a001099more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

First, I took some screenshots and was inspecting them at high zoom trying to work out the exact nature of the fault. Once I had some initial predictions in place I decided to remove some minor adjustments and see if the fault at best went away or at least was shown any more clearly; turns out the fault went away entirely and as you can see both the border around the cover art badge and the track progress bar are much clearer and sharper now, with no unnecessary anti-aliasing.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001109more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>I was at first a little puzzled why this is the case. I had explicitly added 0.5 to some of the coordinates used during the drawing process because I want to make sure that my lines coincided with screen pixels rather than abstract coordinate system pixels. Evidently my understanding of the Cocoa drawing system was a little misguided; <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaDrawingGuide/Transforms/chapter_4_section_2.html\">Apple&apos;s docs</a> say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Once in device space, you can manipulate your coordinates as needed to make them look the way you want. In the example, the object boundaries are normalized to integer coordinates and then shifted by 0.5 units to produce crisper boundary lines.</blockquote>\n\n<p>But as <a href=\"http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/message/cocoa/2004/2/14/97119\">Chris Hanson notes</a> it is a little more complicated than that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Of course, sometimes you want to do something device-specific like draw a hairline.  You don&apos;t want to specify that the line is 1 point, or 0.5 points, or 0.1 points, or...  So the PostScript imaging model gives you a shortcut; you can set the line width to 0.0, and this is interpreted as &quot;the thinnest line you can draw on this device.&quot;<br>\n<br>\nQuartz complicates things further because right now its primary rendering target has a relatively low resolution (72dpi).  It employs antialiasing to get a higher effective resolution out of the screen. Drawing on the coordinates means that a one-point line will half-cover two device pixels, which means it has to antialias to make the line appear correctly.<br>\n<br>\nBut on a 72dpi screen, that&apos;s not necessarily the effect you want.  So you can shift the 72dpi user coordinate system by (0.5, 0.5) to make rendering occur down the center of the 72dpi device coordinate system. You need to be aware exactly why you&apos;re doing this, though, so you can avoid doing it in situations where the user and device coordinate systems aren&apos;t identical.</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&apos;s all a bit confusing but with the aid of a few images all should become clear... First up, we have a simple rectangle with origin <tt>0, 0</tt> and size <tt>9, 7</tt> (width, height):</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"rectangle.png\" src=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/rectangle.png\" width=\"465\" height=\"326\"></p>\n\n<p>Note that when we fill the rectangle the integral coordinates give us a clean rectangle whose contents exactly correspond to screen pixels and there is no anti-aliasing.</p>\n\n<p>But note what happens if we instead draw only the edges of the rectangle. The sides are lines of width <tt>1</tt>, the bottom left corner has coordinates <tt>0, 0</tt> and the top right corner is at <tt>9, 7</tt>:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"path.png\" src=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/path.png\" width=\"478\" height=\"327\"></p>\n\n<p>Note that despite the identical coordinates this rectangle does not match the previous one. The lines are one pixel wide but they straddle physical screen pixels and so when rendered to the screen will probably be anti-aliased and are likely to be blurry. To correct this we would instead have to locate the bottom left corner at <tt>0.5, 0.5</tt> and the top right at <tt>8.5, 6.5</tt>.</p>\n\n<p>This was the mistake I made when I first made the tweaks to my Dock icon code. I forgot that the offset-by-half-a-pixel trick only made sense for drawing lines, not filled rectangles. This is why my progress bar looked blurry.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of the cover art border I made the same mistake. This was not drawn using lines (although it is drawn using an <tt>NSBezierPath</tt>) and so it is a mistake to offset the coordinates by half a pixel. The &quot;donut&quot; is basically an outer rectangle with a hole cut out of it, defined by another rectangle, and so the offset-by-half technique should not be applied:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"donut.png\" src=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/donut.png\" width=\"456\" height=\"332\"></p>\n</div></div>",

A positive side-effect, probably, will be a more concerned (security-wise) user-base and better practices from the management side of Apple. Also, we want to develop and provide tools and documented techniques to aid security research in this platform.</blockquote>\n\n<p>But one thing I don&apos;t agree with is that the organizers have stated that they won&apos;t be notifying Apple prior to making the disclosures:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Rarely, <em>the point is releasing them without vendor notification</em> [emphasis added]. Although, sometimes we may decide to pass an issue through the appropriate people. The problem with so-called &apos;responsible disclosure&apos; is that for some people, it means keeping others on hold for insane amounts of time, even when the fix should be trivial. And the reward (automated responses and euphemism-heavy advisories) doesn&apos;t pay off in the end.</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is completely unethical and a bogus argument to boot. They&apos;ll <em>still</em> get the &quot;automated responses&quot; and there&apos;ll <em>still</em> be &quot;euphemism-heavy advisories&quot;; and when Apple releases the fixes we&apos;ll all <em>still</em> get watered-down descriptions of the faults. If the organizers don&apos;t want to be kept on &quot;hold for insane amounts of time&quot; then they should have set a time-limit after which they&apos;d go public, it&apos;s that simple.</p>\n\n<p>I would suggest that they inform Apple privately and give them 30 days to respond; this interval gives them a reasonable and fair period in which to engineer, test and deliver a fix. If Apple doesn&apos;t supply a fix within 30 days then by all means go public, but if you purposely flood the Internet with detailed information on how to exploit hitherto unknown flaws in Mac OS X you risk doing more harm to users than good. What is so urgent about all this that these flaws must be disclosed right now at absolutely any cost? And if 30 days seems too long to you, why not wait at least 7 days? That&apos;s not long enough for Apple to investigate the flaw then develop, test and deploy the fix, but at least you could then argue that there was a shred of ethics and responsibility in your approach. But purposely throwing out these disclosures tabloid-style? Where are the ethics in that?</p>\n\n<p>They could meet all their stated goals (improving security of the platform, awareness raising etc) and generate a huge amount of publicity while still engaging in ethical and responsible disclosure. Instead, they&apos;ve tarnished the image of a very worthwhile project and have impregnated the whole thing with an air of egocentrism, self-aggrandizement and &quot;script-kiddiness&quot;. I hope they change their minds. It&apos;s still not too late.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001110more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

My existing Comodo-supplied certificate, the one that backs the <a href=\"https://secure.wincent.com/a/store/\">Wincent online store</a>, is due to expire on 15 April 2007, so by switching to RapidSSL I can bump the expiry date back to 15 April 2008 for free. Furthermore, as noted in the article linked to above, there are <a href=\"http://www.servertastic.com/store/product.asp?numRecordPosition=1&amp;P_ID=222\">competitive renewal deals</a> offered by RapidSSL resellers like <a href=\"http://www.servertastic.com/index.asp\">ServerTastic</a>. At the time of writing you can get your SSL certificate for as little as $10 per year.</p>\n\n<p>Better still, RapidSSL certificates are directly signed by a root certificate rather than requiring an intermediate certificate chain. Although it makes no real difference for end users this is a <a href=\"http://gagravarr.org/writing/openssl-certs/personal.shtml\">big deal</a> for you if you&apos;re an administrator because it makes your set-up so much easier. </p>\n\n<blockquote>In some cases, the CA which signed your certificate is not a root CA, but is a CA signed by a CA (or signed by a CA who was signed by a CA who is a root CA, etc.) This is often known as a chained certificate, or a ca-bundle.<br>\n<br>\nWhat makes things tricky is that the remote client will look at your certificate, and try to verify it against the root CAs it knows about. If there is an intermediate CA between you and the CA the client knows about, it will need this certificate to sucessfully verify your certificate. As such, the server needs to not only provide clients with its own certificate, but also those of the intermediate CAs.</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I set up secure IMAP and POP access for the first time it was actually quite a tricky process because I had to not only ensure that I provided my server with my certificate, the signing certificate, and my private key, but I also had to make sure that the items were in the right order. This was entirely a trial-and-error process as I couldn&apos;t find any information about it on the web. In the end I found that the required order was:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Private key</li>\n<li>Certificate</li>\n<li>Signing certificate</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Any other order and things simply didn&apos;t work. With RapidSSL, however, all of this is a non-issue. The certificate is directly signed by a well-known root certificate, so it should be a drop-in replacement for HTTPS, IMAP, POP and whatever other service you wish to use it with.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001111more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>Update</h4>\n\n<p>RapidSSL took a few hours to actually issue the certificate. Note the difference between the old, chained certificate:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"old-cert.png\" src=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/old-cert.png\" width=\"534\" height=\"268\"></p>\n\n<p>And the new, root-signed certificate:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"new-cert.png\" src=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/new-cert.png\" width=\"582\" height=\"435\"></p>\n\n<p>Also nice to see that they in fact extended the expiry date by more than a year, adding on a few additional weeks (to 5 May 2008) for free.</p>\n\n<p>Installing the certificate was fairly easy; I made some notes about it <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Installing_a_new_SSL_certificate\">here</a>.</p>\n</div></div>",

Basically, all messages included a header that began like this:</p>\n\n<pre>Received: from [192.168.1.128] (external.host.name [w.x.y.z])</pre>\n\n<p>Where <tt>external.host.name</tt> was the name corresponding to the external (world-facing) address of my ADSL modem/router and <tt>w.x.y.z</tt> was the IP address. Now there is no real way of concealing the external address, nor any justification for doing so, but why was the internal address being leaked?</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001118more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>I confirmed that mail received from friends running Mail.app on Mac OS X also included the IP address of their internal networks, yet when I checked the headers produced by a different Mac OS X client (Entourage) the IP address wasn&apos;t present.</p>\n\n<p>So in order to get to the bottom of this I decided to rule out Mail.app and connect directly to my server using the command line as <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Testing_services_with_telnet\">described here</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>The verdict</h4>\n\n<p>It turns out that whatever value you send in the <tt>EHLO</tt> command during the <tt>SMTP</tt> session gets included in the header.

What&apos;s the justification for this information leakage (however trivial and harmless) across the boundary of the LAN?

I&apos;ve dabbled in Ruby enough to at least be able to try <em>modifying</em> Ruby code even though I am pretty slow at bashing out clean-room code myself (requiring constant consultation of the documentation).</p>\n\n<p>Doing a ground-up rewrite of Cheetah in Ruby would be a daunting task and far beyond me. But writing something which does only the basic operations I want, nothing more, and addresses the problems I have with Cheetah, could probably be done in a few days. This has a much narrower scope than Cheetah, it is only really intended for compiling and filing static templates (to produce help documentation).</p>\n\n<p>So I started work on this yesterday. I am close to a new release of <a href=\"http://synergyadvance.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> and I want to get at least some documentation out with it; so it makes sense to invest a few days on this template stuff right now. I&apos;ll be much happier adding custom functionality to my templates in Ruby than I was trying to do it in Python.</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;m using a totally Test-Driven Development (or Behaviour-Driven Development if you prefer) paradigm, perfect for someone who&apos;s not really an expert in the language. I find that in my Cocoa development my unit tests are typically written during and after the code-writing; the tests serve to <em>confirm</em> that my code does what I think it does. But in the case of Ruby, where I have much less experience, I am finding that writing the tests <em>before</em> I write the code is very, very helpful. Now they don&apos;t just <em>confirm</em> that things work, they actual <em>drive</em> and <em>guide</em> me along the way in incremental steps. They also provide me with a degree of confidence in the code that I&apos;m writing which I couldn&apos;t possibly have without them, given my level of experience with Ruby.</p>\n\n<p>This is just another step in a long journey for me when it comes to writing documentation. I&apos;ve moved from raw HTML through to PHP (basically using it as a <em>procedural</em> template system), on to Object-Oriented templating (with Cheetah) and finally now trying to switch to a totally custom Ruby subset. This doesn&apos;t even count the side trips into the land of DocBook.</p>\n\n<p>Despite my lack of expertise, Ruby is fairly quick and easy to work with. I am hoping that by the end of today I&apos;ll have the basic parser/compiler up and running, along with the first few directives that I want to support. Driven by irony, I&apos;ve decided to call my Cheetah subset/clone &quot;Walrus&quot;.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001119more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

Giving a bunch of enthusiasts a few extra hours to prepare their &quot;fixes&quot; (really, &quot;fixing&quot; this stuff with APE is like using a radio-controlled robot to stick a band-aid on the arm of a running child) does little to shield users, and it&apos;s really the possible harm to users which concerns me, not Apple&apos;s wounded pride.</p>\n\n<p>Don&apos;t get me wrong, I think the &quot;moabfixes&quot; team is doing a wonderful job and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re doing it. But collaborating with a grey hat who&apos;s doing everything he possibly can to generate scandal and publicity at any cost is of dubious value.</p>\n\n<p>Ah well, one thing is for sure, LMH is raising a lot of awareness.

If the developers have left a binary executed with root privileges at an user-writable path, they are certainly capable of doing other non-sense ... a jackass third-party which has no security background at all and spends more time flaming and insulting on a delusional IRC channel than on real work (sic, stupidity is so vindictive!).</blockquote>\n\n<p>So things really are deteriorating into a nasty sideshow, with childishness and misleading or incorrect claims on both sides. I don&apos;t doubt that APE has flaws, but this latest vulnerability seems to be more about ego-stoking and &quot;p4wning&quot; than anything else. I think the MOAB grey hats need to get back on track and report some real Apple security issues if they want to retain any credibility.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001122more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

The page isn&apos;t very legibly written so here is the summary: the MOAB organizers set up a &quot;canary trap&quot; that included a simple back door (not a root kit); this trap caught only a small number of people who were trying to find out about the exploit <em>before</em> the advisory was made public; on downloading the back door (an unannounced executable, closed source, from an untrusted source who has already demonstrated somewhat unconventional ethical framework) they proceeded to execute the code.</p>\n\n<p>Moral of the story: do not install and/or run software from untrusted third parties. This is not actually a new lesson at all, but it&apos;s worth underlining it right now, especially when you go beyond &quot;untrusted&quot; third parties and start talking about &quot;distrusted&quot; ones. If you want to play with the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/01/month_of_apple.php\">MOAB</a> vulnerabilities you should be doing it on a properly isolated machine, one which you&apos;re prepared to wipe clean and start from scratch with afterwards, and certainly not on a production machine.

But this is open source. Why did the organizers choose to publish the vulnerability without first notifying the vendors? Why didn&apos;t they just submit patches?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://applefun.blogspot.com/2007/01/colloquy-is-vulnerable-to-format-string.html\">They state</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Colloquy development people fortunately fixed the issue promptly in the changeset 3558. Thanks to Joe for bringing this to our attention. Kudos to the Colloquy development team, that&apos;s the way to go!</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Fortunately</em> fixed the issue promptly? If they&apos;re so happy to see it fixed, why didn&apos;t they just send a fix to the team themselves?</p>\n\n<p>Check out <a href=\"http://projects.info-pull.com/moab/index.html#about\">the stated goals</a> of the project:</p>\n\n<blockquote>This initiative aims to serve as an effort to improve Mac OS X, uncovering and finding security flaws in different Apple software and third-party applications designed for this operating system. A positive side-effect, probably, will be a more concerned (security-wise) user-base and better practices from the management side of Apple.</blockquote>\n\n<p>This vulnerability, like the VLC one, is a case of &quot;uncovering and finding&quot; a security flaw, but it has nothing to do with Apple and will have no effect on the &quot;practices from the management side of Apple&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I grudgingly concede that publishing the advisory may help produce a &quot;more concerned (security-wise) user base&quot; (ask yourself, what would have happened if they just quietly submitted a fix?) but the choice of Colloquy as a target seems to be more about making the <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/moabfixes?lnk=oa\">&quot;MOAB Fixes&quot; group</a> look like fools by targeting one of the tools they use.</p>\n\n<p>There is no doubt in my mind that the people behind MOAB know much more about security than the bulk of the developers in the fixes group; I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any need to go around proving it or &quot;teaching lessons&quot;. Wouldn&apos;t focussing on <em>Apple</em> vulnerabilities be much more congruent with the stated aims of the project?</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001128more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

GoDaddy itself comes in at third place with <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/low_price.asp?se=%2B&amp;app_hdr=&amp;ci=4633\">this ironically titled page</a>, &quot;Why Our Prices Are So Low&quot;.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001129more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>So, thankyou Google, for putting a smile on my face prior to today&apos;s battle with GoDaddy... But it seems that there is no easy way of finding out renewal prices without actually starting the renewal process (could it be that GoDaddy <em>doesn&apos;t want you to know</em>?), although I did finally find <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/jump_pages/chart.asp?se=%2B&amp;app%5Fhdr=0&amp;ci=6773&amp;chartType=8&amp;extraDelimited=%7Ccom%7Cnet%7Corg%7Cinfo\">this</a> (but don&apos;t expect the link to survive for long).</p>\n\n<p>Lessons to be learned from that table:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Multi-year registrations don&apos;t give you any discount at all unless you renew more than five domains at once.</li>\n<li>If you renew more than five days at once you&apos;ll be getting a discount anyway in most cases (although not a very steep one).</li>\n<li>Take dot-com domains for example: you&apos;ll save a dollar per domain if you renew more than 5, but in order to save a further 18 cents you&apos;ll have to renew all five for five years (the equivalent of at least 30 years in one go) and to get the final 22 cents you&apos;ll need to do ten-year renewals (the equivalent of paying GoDaddy for 60 years in one go).</li>\n<li>As already noted, suckers who get lured in by the offer of discounted privacy will find their renewal prices doubled, forever, until the end of time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>To multi/bulk, or not to multi/bulk?</h4>\n\n<p>Multi-year or bulk-registrations involve handing over a great deal of money to GoDaddy in one hit. Even before we start talking about private registration 60 &quot;domain-years&quot; at $7.50 (plus 25 cent ICANN fee) is $465. If you can wangle the $4.95 price for privacy then you&apos;re looking at a cool $765.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with this is that you&apos;re tying up your money with GoDaddy and they&apos;re making money off it when you could be earning interest off it. The only benefit to you is that longer term renewals lock you in to a set price for that period and protect you from the inevitable price increases that we can expect from Verisign (who sets the wholesale price that GoDaddy pays) which are likely to be of the order of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/07/godaddy_scam.php\">7% per year</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s really up to you do decide whether it&apos;s worth it to go for bulk or multi-year renewals. If you can get a cheap price on private registration then it may be worth thinking about it seeing as GoDaddy seems quite intractable about their ridiculous pricing. You may also consider switching to another registrar; there are <a href=\"http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2005/09/21/vipcom_domain_sells_for_14_million.html\">several</a> with non-promotional, standard prices that beat GoDaddy&apos;s non-promotional price. <a href=\"http://www.netfirms.com/\">Netfirms</a>, for example, sells domains for $4.95 per year.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, it is a good idea to keep an eye on <a href=\"http://news.netcraft.com/archives/domains.html\">Netcraft&apos;s &quot;Domains&quot; category</a> for reports on industry movements. Promotional prices do drop <a href=\"http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2005/11/28/yahoo_ipowerweb_slash_domain_prices_to_below_3.html\">below the $3 mark</a> although few beat GoDaddy&apos;s own $1.99 domains (new registrations, when purchasing a non-domain product). But that&apos;s really only helpful for new domain purchases: remember that GoDaddy&apos;s motto is &quot;suck &apos;em in cheap, then gouge and scrape till there&apos;s nothing left&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>The current state of play, however, is that none of the alternatives to GoDaddy are attractive enough to allow me to migrate away. Take <a href=\"http://www.netfirms.com/\">Netfirms</a>, for example: their domains are cheap, they even come with <a href=\"http://www.netfirms.com/domain-names/\">free private registration</a>, but the $4.95 is for the first year only and renewals are at $9.95 per year after that. This effectively makes the $4.95 offer a promotional price, although the fact that privacy is included still puts them in front of GoDaddy, who doesn&apos;t even come close to offering renewals of a private domain for less than $10. The deal-breaker, however, is that there is a limit of 5 discounted domains per customer.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://1and1.com/\">1&amp;1</a> also offers <a href=\"http://order.1and1.com/xml/order/InstantDomaininfoPdr;jsessionid=38D80B49B813222BF6EF1E3B11555D6A.TC61a?__frame=_top&amp;__lf=Static\">free private registration</a> and cheap domains ($5.99) but I am unable to find any information on their site about renewal costs. It seems unlikely that the below-wholesale price of $5.99 would apply for renewals.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hostway.com/\">Hostway&apos;s</a> &quot;Domain Protector&quot; is a non-contender <a href=\"http://www.hostway.com/smb/whoisprotector/whoisprotectorfaq.html#5\">at nearly $10 per domain</a>.</p>\n\n<h4>My one and only transaction with GoDaddy for 2007</h4>\n\n<p>This month alone I&apos;ve let four domains expire because I refused to cave in to GoDaddy&apos;s bait and switch tactics. There are five more domains due to expire in 2007 that I won&apos;t be renewing. This is lost business for GoDaddy. It&apos;s pained me a bit to do so as it has meant letting some product-name domains go which I&apos;ve given out so that users could have easy-to-remember shortcuts to my product websites (for example, <a href=\"http://bansshee.org/\">bansshee.org</a> currently serves as a convenient shorthand for being redirected to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/bansshee/\">http://www.wincent.com/a/products/bansshee/</a>) but these will eventually all go away, all references to them will die off, and everything will just live under <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/\">wincent.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I think the signs are already in place that GoDaddy&apos;s days of private-registration abuse are numbered. Numbered not in the sense that they&apos;ll stop doing it, rather in the sense that there will be alternatives for people like me who care about privacy but don&apos;t want to treated with corporate contempt. There are already companies offering free private registration and Netfirms looks to be the most promising prospect at this stage: given that the wholesale price of a domain is $6, Netfirms&apos; $9.95 renewal price, inclusive of private registration, is starting to look fair. It&apos;s still a huge margin, but it&apos;s starting to look reasonable. If market forces can push things down by a couple of dollars then I&apos;ll be very satisfied.</p>\n\n<p>So taking into consideration that market forces will soon inevitably produce escape routes from GoDaddy I decided to handle my remaining GoDaddy renewals for 2007 in one go, and it may well be the last time I ever pay GoDaddy a cent.</p>\n\n<p>I had six more domains registered with GoDaddy and due to expire 2007; these were essential domains like <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/\">wincent.com</a> which I just can&apos;t allow to expire. Until a clear, reputable competitor to GoDaddy emerges with a proven track record (and Netfirms looks to be the best candidate right now), I figured I would do one more renewal with GoDaddy. By renewing all six at once I qualified for the first tier of special bulk pricing. I first tried to renew them for ten years but GoDaddy informed me that I had exceeded the &quot;maximum renewal period&quot; (is that something arbitrary imposed by them to stop people ever getting the maximum discount level? or is it an ICANN thing?). So the next best thing was to do 9-year renewals, thus allowing me to forget about private registration hassles and increasing wholesale prices until 2016.</p>\n\n<p>Market forces will exert downwards pressure on domain prices, but it is inevitable that the wholesale price will go up. I fear in part that this is because of the ridiculous amount of domain-parking being down trying to generate revenue from advertisements. But in my view, raising the price of domains is not the correct solution to this problem; the correct solution is to switch to advertisements which are pay-per-sale rather than pay-per-view or pay-per-click.</p>\n\n<p>I did my usual trick of cancelling my private registration just prior to renewing and then re-adding it so as to get it for $4.99 instead of $8.99 (still too much, but better than no discount at all). I also scoured the web looking for <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=es&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=es&amp;q=godaddy+promo+code&amp;btnG=B&#xFA;squeda&amp;lr=\">GoDaddy promo codes</a>. The base price for the six domains, nine years each, with private registration and ICANN fees was $739.03. The promo code <tt>zine3</tt> brought it down to $716.89, and <tt>TODD</tt> did slightly better, bringing it down to $710.67. But the best code of all was actually one that GoDaddy itself had sent me a few days ago,  begging me to renew my expired domains: <tt>GDBBREN8</tt>; with this the final price came down to $681.15, or $12.61 per domain, per year. Still far too much money for a dream customer who over the years has registered <em>a lot</em> of domains; I think $7 to $10 would be a much fairer price per domain.</p>\n\n<p>I still have some other domains at GoDaddy but the renewal dates are a few years off (in the 2010 to 2015 range). The domains I renewed today will expire in 2016. So basically, it looks like GoDaddy has seen the last it will ever see of my cash. When these domains expire I&apos;ll either be letting the non-essential ones go, or transferring the essential ones to a new registrar.</p>\n\n<h4>Update (19 January 2006):</h4>\n\n<p>Jim Hoyt contacted me to recommend <a href=\"http://www.sitelutions.com/\">sitelutions.com</a> as an inexpensive registrar (<a href=\"http://www.sitelutions.com/info/slregistrar\">$8.75 per year</a>); I don&apos;t know if they offer private registrations.</p>\n</div></div>",

I really think the only real value in the kind of hard work that Landon and William are doing is the intellectual and self-educational value of it that they derive from it themselves; a more appropriate workaround for the flaw, in my opinion, is to uninstall Transmit and use one of the many alternatives available until Panic releases a fix.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Maybe Panic is on holiday. Maybe they haven&apos;t gotten back from Macworld yet. But if their software were open source then it wouldn&apos;t matter if they were voyaging across the Sahara desert; literally anybody with the appropriate knowledge could fix the problem in their absence.</p>\n\n<p>Now I&apos;m not saying that they should open source their software. I&apos;ve previously written about open source and noted how it doesn&apos;t make much business sense for the small vendor (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2005/07/open_source_lic.php\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/04/open_source_a_w.php\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/09/open_vs_closed.php\">3</a>), but this month of MOAB has made me think again how nice it would be if there were a viable way of opening up our source without simultaneously destroying our livelihoods. I am seriously considering opening up access to my source in some way in the future, although I highly doubt that either the GPL or the BSD licenses are appropriate, but perhaps there is another way; the model provided by <a href=\"http://hogbaysoftware.com/\">Hog Bay Software</a> is one to think about.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001131more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p><a href=\"http://www.ruby-lang.org/es/\">Ruby</a> is my favorite scripting language. Let me clarify: I <em>like</em> Ruby; it generates warm fuzzy feelings in my thorax when I think about it. This is quite different from my response to other scripting languages: <a href=\"http://www.perl.org/\">Perl</a> tends to provoke anything from respect to mild irritation; <a href=\"http://php.net/\">PHP</a> generates scorn, contempt, sometimes even pity; and <a href=\"http://python.org/\">Python</a> provokes uncertainty because I don&apos;t understand it.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001137more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>Why I like Ruby</h4>\n\n<p>So I have an emotional attachment to Ruby even though I&apos;ve never really done any big projects in it and I am far from being an expert. I like it because everything in Ruby is an object, even literal numbers like <tt>1</tt> and <tt>2</tt> are instances of the <tt>Fixnum</tt> class. <tt>nil</tt>, <tt>true</tt> and <tt>false</tt> are all objects. <em>Everything</em>, absolutely everything inherits from <tt>Object</tt>.</p>\n\n<p>Ruby comes with a solid and comprehensive standard library, and the core language itself has implementations of all the primitive object types you&apos;re likely to care about: strings, numbers, arrays, hashes, regular expressions and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>Just like Objective-C, Ruby is highly dynamic and its notion of Object-Orientation is based on a message-sending. You can create classes on the fly, add and remove methods, mix-in methods from elsewhere on demand (similar to protocols in Objective-C except that you can actually share the method implementations across classes), and do pretty much anything with the runtime that you want.</p>\n\n<p>There are very powerful flow control mechanisms which include all the usual iterator and loop structures, plus exception raising and rescuing, arbitrary symbol throwing and catching, and the fiendishly powerful continuations (like <tt>setjmp()/longjmp()</tt> on steroids).</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s easy to use a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/hom/\">higher-order messaging</a> programming style in Ruby because the language itself provides built-in syntax for blocks, anonymous functions, closures, and the like. Common HOM patterns like &quot;each&quot;, &quot;collect&quot;, &quot;select&quot; are easy because classes like <tt>Array</tt> implement them right out of the box.</p>\n\n<p>But to date I haven&apos;t taken on any big projects in Ruby even though I have used it for a couple of scripts here (one for reformatting source code which I have bound to a hot-key in Xcode, and one as a post-commit hook script that posts entries to my &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/\">Subversion log</a>&quot; every time I do a commit to the repository). When time permits I eventually plan to do a <a href=\"http://rubyonrails.org/\">Ruby on Rails</a> monster web app to handle absolutely everything on <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/\">wincent.com</a> and do away with the complicated mis-mash of independent apps that I&apos;m currently using to run the <a href=\"http://colaiuta.net/\">weblogs</a>, the <a href=\"http://kbase.wincent.com/\">wiki</a>, the <a href=\"http://forums.wincent.com/\">forums</a>, the <a href=\"http://bugs.wincent.com/\">bug tracking and feature requests database</a>, the <a href=\"https://secure.wincent.com/a/support/registration/\">lost serial recovery system</a>, the <a href=\"http://lists.wincent.com/\">mailing lists</a> and so forth. But before I can even contemplate such a large project I need to become more familiar with the language, and one of the ways I&apos;ve been doing that is through working on a parser generator.</p>\n\n<h4>Writing a parser generator</h4>\n\n<p>I&apos;m putting together a new <a href=\"http://advance.wincent.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> release and part of that is preparing a huge amount of documentation. To allow me to concentrate on content rather than presentation details <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/01/testdriven_deve.php\">I&apos;ve been developing</a> an object-oriented templating system.</p>\n\n<p>Part of this involved hand-coding a parser for processing the template language. But as <a href=\"http://www.parr.us/terence\">Terence Parr</a> (of <a href=\"http://www.antlr.org/\">ANTLR</a> fame) says (with some irony!), &quot;Why program by hand in five days what you can spend five years of your life automating?&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>The thing is, however, Ruby is such a good language that not only can you probably hand-code a parser in five days (while simultaneously learning the language), it makes it feasible to develop a parser <em>generator</em> in five-days.</p>\n\n<h4>An object-oriented parser generator</h4>\n\n<p>To get an idea of how quick it can be to whip up a parser in Ruby, check out what I turned up with my very first Google search:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.rubyinside.com/recursive-descent-parser-for-ruby-300.html\">A customizable recursive-descent parser in 250 lines of Ruby</a>.</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/\">Packrat parser</a> in <a href=\"http://meta-meta.blogspot.com/2006/04/packrat-parsers.html\">211 lines of Ruby</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My searches lead me to the <a href=\"http://www.syngress.com/\">Syngress</a> <a href=\"http://www.syngress.com/book_catalog/183_ruby/\">Ruby Developer&apos;s Guide</a> by Feldt, Johnson and Neumann wherein is described an amazing &quot;parsing library of your dreams&quot; which turns out to be Rockit, by one of the authors. Unfortunately, although Rockit looks absolutely wonderful it remains vaporware for the time being. The book itself talks about &quot;version 0.4&quot; of Rockit but as far as I can tell, this was never released into the wild, and existed only on the author&apos;s computer.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://rockit.sourceforge.net/\">old Sourceforge project page</a> is stuck at version 0.3.8 (from 2001) and although the newer <a href=\"http://rubyforge.org/projects/rockit\">RubyForge project page</a> features version 0.7.2 (from March 2006) there is no Subversion access to see work in progress, and the code that is available is still very incomplete. The included README states:</p>\n\n<pre>Lots of stuff that will be in 0.8.0 is not in this release:<br>\n<br>\n  * Proper memoization (&#xE0; la packrat)\n  * Optimization\n  * Error reporting\n  * Java grammar\n  * Ruby grammar\n  * many of the good stuff from older Rockit versions (tree pattern matching, fully automated AST generation etc)</pre>\n\n<p>It&apos;s more than a little unfortunate that the author chose to describe Rockit as &quot;the parsing library of your dreams&quot;, because Rockit largely remains in the world of dreams rather than the real world. Nevertheless, the chapter in the Syngress book is full of little ideas that make you say, &quot;wouldn&apos;t it be nice if... (things worked this way)&quot;.</p>\n\n<h4>Design</h4>\n\n<p>So I started work on my own parser generator. In doing so I&apos;ve had my love of the Object-Oriented programming reaffirmed and I&apos;ve had the great pleasure of learning to work with <a href=\"http://rubyforge.org/projects/rspec/\">RSpec</a>, the amazing Behaviour-Driven Development framework for Ruby.</p>\n\n<p>In this article I&apos;m going to describe the basic building blocks of the parser generator. In a subsequent article I will describe how this can be extended to generate rich Abstract Syntax Trees rather than just generating a &quot;dumb&quot; hierarchy.</p>\n\n<h4>Parslets</h4>\n\n<p>The core idea is to develop &quot;parslets&quot; which are not full parsers in themselves (hence the name) but which are specialized to parse only one, very well-defined thing. Parslets either succeed if the input conforms to their expectations, or they raise an exception.</p>\n\n<p>For example, we could have a <tt>StringParslet</tt> that is specialized in parsing strings. You could create a <tt>StringParslet</tt> configured to parse the word &quot;foobar&quot;.</p>\n\n<pre>parslet.parse(&apos;foobar&apos;) # succeeds!\nparslet.parse(&apos;foo&apos;) # raises an exception, describing failure to find &apos;bar&apos; after &apos;foo&apos;</pre>\n\n<p>You could also have <tt>RegexpParslets</tt> which specialize in matching regular expressions. Imagine such a parslet configured to recognize runs of digits (based on the regular expression, <tt>/\\d+/</tt>:</p>\n\n<pre>parslet.parse(&apos;11223344...&apos;) # succeeds\nparslet.parse(&apos;&apos;) # fails</pre>\n\n<p>The first line in the example above would succeed, consuming the digits &quot;11223344&quot; and stopping (the idea is that parsing the remainder of the string would be handed off to another parslet). The second line in the example would fail because there are no digits to consume and the regular expression requires &quot;<em>at least one</em> digit&quot; in order to produce a match.</p>\n\n<p>Parslets are very simple objects and they are designed to do a limited task well. To the basic behaviour of parsing (recognizing and consuming characters) we can add simple error reporting (the exception thrown in response to a parsing failure can contain embedded information about exactly where the failure occurred, and how the actual input differed from the expected input).</p>\n\n<h4>Parslet combinations</h4>\n\n<p>As limited as they are, parslets are not very useful in isolation but they can become quite powerful when combined. For example, you could chain together a sequence of parslets into a sequence (&quot;parse &apos;foo&apos;, then &apos;bar&apos;, then a number&quot;), or you could express choices between parslets (&quot;parse &apos;foo&apos; or &apos;bar&apos; or a number&quot;), or state repetitions of parslets (&quot;parse one of more &apos;foo&apos; strings&quot;).</p>\n\n<p>You could then nest or combine these parslets to describe complex combinations (&quot;parse &apos;foo&apos; or &apos;bar&apos;, followed by a number or punctuation, followed by a comma, repeated zero or more times&quot;).</p>\n\n<p>So we add a <tt>ParsletCombination</tt> class and a number of subclasses: <tt>ParsletSequence</tt> (for chaining), <tt>ParsletChoice</tt> (for choosing between parslets), <tt>ParsletRepetition</tt> (for specifying the repeat behaviour of a parslet). By using <tt>ParsletCombinations</tt> we keep the parslets themselves simple; they don&apos;t have to worry about keeping track of their relationships with other parslets, they can just focus on their own task.</p>\n\n<h4>Convenience methods</h4>\n\n<p>Ruby is highly Object-Oriented (and message-oriented too), and it makes it easy to add methods which look like operators. That is:</p>\n\n<pre>1 + 1</pre>\n\n<p>Is actually the message, <tt>+</tt>, being sent to the <tt>1</tt> object, and the parameter passed in is <tt>1</tt>, another object. Likewise:</p>\n\n<pre>&quot;foo&quot; + &quot;bar&quot; # returns &quot;foobar&quot;</pre>\n\n<p>Is the message, <tt>+</tt>, being sent to the <tt>&quot;foo&quot;</tt> object with <tt>&quot;bar&quot;</tt> (another object), as the parameter.</p>\n\n<p>Ruby is dynamic too. It allows us to add methods to existing classes and so that means that a method called <tt>&amp;</tt> can be added to the <tt>String</tt> class so that:</p>\n\n<pre>&apos;foo&apos; &amp; &apos;bar&apos;</pre>\n\n<p>Will actually evaluate to a <tt>ParsletSequence</tt> object that will run two <tt>StringParslets</tt> in order, one custom-built to parse the string &quot;foo&quot; and the other for parsing the string &quot;bar&quot;. We can perform a similar addition for the <tt>Regexp</tt> class and add a <tt>|</tt> method as well which will serve as a shorthand for creating <tt>ParsletChoice</tt> objects.</p>\n\n<pre>&apos;foo&apos; | &apos;bar&apos; &amp; /\\d+/</pre>\n\n<p>This produces a parslet combination that will parse strings like &quot;foo&quot; or &quot;bar99&quot;. We can use parentheses too to override precedence:</p>\n\n<pre>(&apos;foo&apos; | &apos;bar&apos;) &amp; /\\d+/</pre>\n\n<p>This combination would parse strings like &quot;foo1&quot; and &quot;bar2&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise we can add methods for specifying repetition:</p>\n\n<pre>&apos;foo&apos;.zero_or_more\n&apos;bar&apos;.optional\n/\\w+\\./.repeat(3, 4)</pre>\n\n<p>The first example parses &quot;foo&quot; repeated zero or more times (like the <tt>*</tt> metacharacter in regular expressions). The second example parses optional elements (like the <tt>?</tt> metacharacter in regular expressions). The final example is like the <tt>{x, y}</tt> specifier in regular expressions, and it means &quot;match a run of &apos;word characters&apos; followed by a period between 3 and 4 times&quot;.</p>\n\n<h4>Predicates</h4>\n\n<p>Although I didn&apos;t know it when I started, I was writing a parser generator that would produce a parser based on a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar\">Parsing Expression Grammar</a> (PEG). PEGs are great for expressing the grammar of programming languages. They map well onto the way humans think about parsing a language, and they are completely unambiguous because they consist of a set of ordered (prioritized) choices and a fixed starting symbol.</p>\n\n<p>One of the features of PEGs are predicates. The &quot;and&quot; predicate is a zero-width parsing assertion which succeeds if a match is found, but it doesn&apos;t actually consume any characters. We represent this using an <tt>and?</tt> method:</p>\n\n<pre>&apos;foo&apos; &amp; &apos;bar&apos;.and?</pre>\n\n<p>This will match &quot;foo&quot; as long as it is followed by &quot;bar&quot; (but note, the parser only looks ahead at the &quot;bar&quot;; it doesn&apos;t actually consume or move past it). Likewise, we can implement a &quot;not&quot; predicate using a <tt>not!</tt> method as follows:</p>\n\n<pre>&apos;foo&apos; &amp; /\\d/.not!</pre>\n\n<p>This will match &quot;foo&quot; as long as it is <em>not</em> followed by a digit. Once again, it&apos;s just lookahead and nothing is actually consumed beyond the &quot;foo&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Strictly speaking these method names break slightly with standard Ruby practice that <tt>!</tt> should be used to indicate a message that has some kind of mutating effect on the receiver itself and <tt>?</tt> would normally indicate a message that returns <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt>. Despite the downside of breaking with convention (potentially violating expectations) the readability benefits for the domain-specific language we are developing are just too great to pass up.</p>\n\n<h4>Domain-Specific languages</h4>\n\n<p>With the basic parslets in place along with the various ways of combining them and specifying predicates we now have the ability to parse just about anything that can be described in a PEG. The next bit of Ruby magic that we&apos;ll use is what&apos;s known as a domain specific language.</p>\n\n<p>Here&apos;s an example:</p>\n\n<pre>grammar = Grammar.subclass(&apos;CommentGrammar&apos;) do\n  rule            :comment,         :comment_marker &amp; :comment_body.optional\n  rule            :comment_marker,  &apos;##&apos;\n  rule            :comment_body,    /.+/\nend</pre>\n\n<p>This is an incomplete grammar which describes how to parse comments in a language where comments are defined as a a comment marker, <tt>##</tt>, optionally followed by &quot;stuff&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>This is a domain-specific langauge because it looks as though Ruby had syntax in it to support the specific task at hand; those <tt>rule</tt> statements aren&apos;t really statements at all; they are message sends to the <tt>rule</tt> method (in the <tt>Grammar</tt> class).</p>\n\n<p>This example also shows off another feature of Ruby: the use of blocks. All the stuff between the <tt>do</tt> and the <tt>end</tt> is code that is passed as a parameter to the <tt>subclass</tt> method of the <tt>Grammar</tt> class. The method creates a brand new subclass on the fly (dynamism) which effectively allows us to define a grammar in its own namespace.</p>\n\n<h4>Recursion</h4>\n\n<p>In the previous example you&apos;ll notice that each rule was identified by a symbol (a name preceded by a colon), and that rules could refer to other rules by using their corresponding symbols. The same grammar could have been written like this:</p>\n\n<pre>grammar = Grammar.subclass(&apos;CommentGrammar&apos;) do\n  comment_marker  = &apos;##&apos;\n  comment_body    = /.+/\n  rule            :comment,         comment_marker &amp; comment_body.optional\nend</pre>\n\n<p>But there is one <em>huge</em> advantage to using symbols to refer to other rules: it allows us to specify recursive (self-referential) rules, or rules which refer to one another in a circular fashion:</p>\n\n<pre>grammar = Grammar.subclass(&apos;NestedGrammar&apos;) do\n  starting_symbol :bracket_expression\n  rule            :left_bracket,        &apos;(&apos;\n  rule            :right_bracket,       &apos;)&apos;\n  rule            :bracket_content,     (/[^()]+/ | :bracket_expression).zero_or_more\n  rule            :bracket_expression,  :left_bracket &amp; :bracket_content.optional &amp; :right_bracket\nend</pre>\n\n<p>Notice how this simple grammar allows nested parentheses, something that to my knowledge simply can&apos;t be done using a regular expression alone. A &quot;bracket expression&quot; can contain just about anything, including other (nested) bracket expressions. The use of symbols allows us to define rules without actually having to fully evaluate them until runtime (or parse time, to be more precise). In this way we can express pretty much anything we want with our PEG.</p>\n\n<p>All of this magic is made possible with a clean syntax due to the power of Ruby continuations. Note that we could have done this without continuations if we had wrapped all symbol references in a &quot;lookup&quot; function:</p>\n\n<pre>rule :one_symbol, &apos;foo&apos; &amp; lookup(:other_symbol)</pre>\n\n<p>This would defer the actual lookup of <tt>:other_symbol</tt> until runtime, but it&apos;s not ideal because it clutters up our domain-specific language with implementation details; the author of the grammar shouldn&apos;t have to worry about how or when symbol lookup occurs.</p>\n\n<p>Continuations make the cleaner syntax possible because they allow for some extremely sophisticated flow-control, and therefore communication, between our grammar and our <tt>SymbolParslet</tt> (yep, that&apos;s right, a specialized parslet dedicated purely to parsing things represented by symbols). Basically, if a <tt>SymbolParslet</tt> doesn&apos;t know what its context is (that is, what grammar it belongs to) it doesn&apos;t now how to &quot;look up&quot; what the symbol means. It can throw an exception which is caught by the grammar, and the grammar then uses the encapsulated continuation object to jump back to the point where the exception was thrown, this time passing a reference to the grammar itself. Continuations can basically be used to jump from anywhere back to a previously denoted point; as I said above, they&apos;re kind of like <tt>setjmp()/longjmp()</tt> on steroids. Normally exceptions are a one-way ticket, but with continuations they can be two-way, and thanks to this flexibility the design of both the grammar and the symbol parslet is kept very simple, and the coupling between them extremely loose and flexible.</p>\n\n<h4>Abstract Syntax Trees</h4>\n\n<p>Up to now I&apos;ve just talked about parsing as recognition; I haven&apos;t said anything about transforming the recognized tokens into a useful structure. In a subsequent article I&apos;ll talk about taking those &quot;dumb&quot; tokens (still &quot;dumb&quot; even though they are organized in a hierarchical structure) and mapping them onto custom classes in an Abstract Syntax Tree.</p>\n\n<p>By way of example, the system described so far would parse a simple assignment expression such as &quot;foo = bar + 1&quot; into an ordered, hierarchical tree of tokens using basic types (<tt>String</tt> and <tt>Array</tt> objects):</p>\n\n<pre>[&apos;foo&apos;, &apos;=&apos;, [&apos;bar&apos;, &apos;+&apos;, &apos;1&apos;]]</pre>\n\n<p>Although this tree structure mirrors the actual semantic structure of the input text it doesn&apos;t describe it fully (the components are not named or identified in any way; at the lowest level the atoms are just unlabelled strings) and it is not in a very usable form (that is, to actually do any useful work with the parse tree you would have to analyse the structure and decide what to do with it).</p>\n\n<p>Abstract Syntax Trees allow us to produce a much more usable representation of the parsed document. Each component in the hierarchy has a specific type (class) and each type has its own attributes. The example above might be represented using the following AST:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Assignment Expression:\n  <ul>\n  <li>lvalue (the assignment target, &quot;foo&quot;)</li>\n  <li>Assignment operator (&quot;=&quot;); in reality this element can be omitted from the syntax tree because it&apos;s not required to convey meaning.</li>\n  <li>Addition expression\n   <ul>\n    <li>lvalue (&quot;bar&quot;)</li>\n    <li>Addition operator (&quot;+&quot;); again this element can be omitted from the syntax tree</li>\n    <li>Numeric literal (&quot;1&quot;)</li>\n   </ul>\n  </li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In a subsequent article I will talk about how to specify &quot;productions&quot; which can be added to rules in the grammar so that they know what elements to &quot;produce&quot; in the final AST output. All productions are element subclasses of <tt>Node</tt> and each may have subnodes or other properties. Here object-oriented design again helps us because once these <tt>Node</tt> subclasses can be easily extended to implement the actual behaviour we want to undertake according to what is fed into the parser; that is, the <tt>AdditionExpression</tt> subclass could easily be extended with logic to perform addition.</p>\n\n<h4>Test-driven and behaviour-driven development insights</h4>\n\n<p>Along the way I&apos;ve had some insights on test and behaviour-driven development. These too will probably have to wait for a separate article but before signing off I&apos;d like to briefly touch on some of the topics.</p>\n\n<p>When I first wrote about <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/01/testdriven_deve.php\">this topic</a> I remarked that due to my relative inexperience with Ruby I wanted my development to be more &quot;test-driven&quot; than is usual for me.</p>\n\n<p>Normally I view writing code, writing code-level documentation, and writing unit tests as being three integral, interrelated parts of the development process. In practice I generally move back and forth among them all, and this works well for me in Objective-C/Cocoa. I feel comfortable in that environment and I generally have a clear idea of the right approach to take for any given task; in this context testing mostly serves to confirm the correctness of the code that I&apos;ve written. It&apos;s great: Unit Testing has spared me many a frustrating debugging session.</p>\n\n<p>My pattern this time, however, has been different. Ruby is an interpreted language, not a compiled one, so it makes it much more feasible to adopt a true &quot;test-driven&quot; style. There are no waits for compilation so it is very, very easy to operate in a cycle:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Decide on the next piece of functionality that must be implemented; if the piece of functionality is large then decide on the first step that must be taken towards implementing it.</li>\n<li>Write a test that checks that the functionality works as intended.</li>\n<li>Run the test; it should fail. If it doesn&apos;t then you know your test is incorrect.</li>\n<li>Write the code needed to pass the test.</li>\n<li>Run the test again; it should pass.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Making sure that the test fails first is important for the following reason: just as it is easy to write broken code, so it is to write broken tests; the extra step provides some assurance that you don&apos;t accidentally wind up with broken code and broken tests that pass because the flaws of one complement the other.</p>\n\n<p>Stricly adhering to this pattern in Cocoa would be simply unworkable given the lengthy turn-around times for compiling (a full Synergy Advance build can take 6 minutes or more); I tend to make as many changes as possible between compiles, only compiling when I have a doubt about whether something will work or not. In Ruby, however, it&apos;s much more practical to rigorously follow the pattern.</p>\n\n<p>So I started off using <a href=\"http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/classes/Test/Unit.html\">Test::Unit</a> and doing the best I could to obediently follow the test-driven development pattern. It&apos;s worked very well. I&apos;ve been consistently pleased with the way that simple classes, well-tested, can be assembled to form a complex whole which just works (and by &quot;just works&quot; I mean &quot;simply works&quot;, not &quot;barely works&quot;!).</p>\n\n<h4>&quot;Bolt-on&quot; testing</h4>\n\n<p>There are three levels on which you can write tests:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>According to the expected functioning of the code under testing: that is, if you have code that adds two numbers, you should plug in values and check that the result of their addition is the one you expect. I often try multiple different values seeking the boundary or edge cases as well as cases that are qualitatively (not quantitatively) different. So if I was working with an array I would most likely test with zero elements, one element, and more than one element because these are all qualitatively different (&quot;plural&quot; is fundamentally different from &quot;singular&quot; and both are different from zero because they don&apos;t possess any &quot;zeroness&quot;).</li>\n<li>According to the documentation for the code under testing: that is, if the API documentation that you write states &quot;raises an exception if passed nil&quot; then you should test that the code actually does what the documentation says it does. You may also chose to test the reverse case (that it doesn&apos;t raise when passed a non-nil value).</li>\n<li>According to the internal implementation details of the code: that is, if you know the internal workings of a method then you can tailor specific tests that check that these internal bits and pieces are in order.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This last level of testing is actually a bit of an anti-pattern. Just as users of an API shouldn&apos;t have to have knowledge of its private implementation details in order to use it, I don&apos;t think your tests should be based on or written for &quot;private&quot; knowledge. Your tests should really be about behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>This is where the term &quot;bolt-on&quot; testing comes it. &quot;Bolt-on&quot; testing is what you do when you write tests <em>after</em> you write your methods. You look at what the methods do and then &quot;bolt&quot; some tests onto them to try them out. &quot;Bolt-on&quot; testing is an anti-pattern, really, although it is better than no testing at all.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes it can be tempting to &quot;bolt-on&quot; too many tests, tests that verify irrelevant details that have little to do with the desired behaviour of the class. As one example, before you write a test to verify that the method you call really does return a <tt>String</tt>, ask yourself, &quot;Does this really matter to the behaviour that I&apos;m looking to implement?&quot;. Working with Ruby I&apos;ve learnt to loosen my tests up a fair bit. Rubyists love the flexibility of &quot;Duck typing&quot; and that often means that writing tests for specific classes like <tt>String</tt> is a bad idea. All you want is something that acts (quacks) like a string, so you should really be testing <em>how it quacks</em>, not <em>what</em> it is. <a href=\"http://www.lukeredpath.co.uk/2006/8/29/developing-a-rails-model-using-bdd-and-rspec-part-1\">This is a great article</a> that discusses this economy of testing in the context of Rails.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike &quot;bolt-on testing&quot;, Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) helps developers avoid these pitfalls by using language that concentrates on the desired behaviour of the code rather than the implementation details. Whereas a &quot;bolt-on&quot; tester will write code to test each method in a class (&quot;unit&quot; testing in the purest sense because methods are generally the smallest atomic units visible from outside of a class), a behaviour-driven tester will write code that confirms only the externally required behaviour of a class. Code coverage tools can (and probably should) be used to confirm that all code paths are actually being touched, but writing exhaustive per-method tests is often not necessary and can actually be harmful when it comes to refactoring.</p>\n\n<p>BDD is more agile because it is not wedded to implementation details. If the implementation changes the tests (called &quot;specifications&quot; or &quot;specs&quot;) shouldn&apos;t need to change.</p>\n\n<p>After a few days of working with Test::Unit I decided to switch to RSpec, a fantastic BDD framework for Ruby development. When you use RSpec you write your tests in &quot;contexts&quot;, and you &quot;specify&quot; what should happen. This language helps you to test the right things because it focusses your attention on the desired behaviour, the desired <em>functionality</em>, rather than the nitty gritty (and in a sense meaningless) <em>operation</em> of the code. Behaviour Driven Development is no different than already existing best practice in Test Driven Development, but the language in the framework helps you to do the right thing and the framework itself has some beautiful dynamic code in it that makes your specifications unbelieveably readable.</p>\n\n<p>Where you would write this contrived example in Test::Unit:</p>\n\n<pre># check that 1 + 2 equals 3\nassert_equal 3, 1 + 2</pre>\n\n<p>You could write this in RSpec:</p>\n\n<pre>context &apos;working with numbers&apos; do\n  specify &apos;should be able to add two integers to obtain a sum&apos; do\n    1 + 2.should == 3\n  end\nend</pre>\n\n<p>Don&apos;t let the extra wordiness of the RSpec example put you off. Remember that in a given &quot;context&quot; there will often be many specifications, and you only have to type the context once. The actual test itself is shorter and reads just like English, &quot;one plus two should equal three&quot;. There is also no scope for confusion about the order of the parameters like there is in the case of <tt>assert_equal</tt>; note how <tt>assert_equal</tt> requires you to remember that the expected result should go on the left and the actual value on the right.</p>\n\n<p>The syntax for working with exceptions is much neater in RSpec too:</p>\n\n<pre># Test::Unit\nassert_raise ArgumentError do\n  Enumerator.new(nil)\nend<br>\n<br>\n# RSpec\ncontext &apos;creating an enumerator&apos; do\n  specify &apos;should complain if initialized with nil&apos; do\n    lambda { Enumerator.new(nil) }.should_raise ArgumentError\n  end\nend</pre>\n\n<p>Again, don&apos;t let the length of the RSpec example put you off. Remember that you only have to write the context once and can use it for many specifications. Also note that the specification serves to clearly document the expected behaviour of the code and that the error message in the event of a failing test will be very clear (&quot;creating an enumerator should complain if initialized with nil&quot;). Also note the highly readable name of the expectation, <tt>should_raise</tt>,  and its logical opposite, <tt>should_not_raise</tt>. Compare this with Test::Unit which uses the <tt>assert_raise</tt> which is not very human-language friendly (you could even argue that it is ungrammatical) and whose opposite seemingly arbitrarily breaks the pattern (&quot;assert&quot; followed by a verb) by being called <tt>assert_nothing_raised</tt> (&quot;assert&quot; followed by an adjectival clause).</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve got <a href=\"http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=8126&amp;group_id=797&amp;atid=3152\">an RSpec feature request</a> open for the addition of an <tt>example</tt> keyword  as well, which could be nested inside a <tt>specify</tt> block for even greater descriptiveness, and which would mirror the way that I work (testing with multiple values, probing boundary cases and qualitatively different data points):</p>\n\n<pre>context &apos;applying a regexp to a string&apos; do\n  specify &apos;should be able to match &quot;zero or more&quot; times&apos; do\n    example &apos;for the zero-match case&apos; do ... end\n    example &apos;for the one-match case&apos; do ... end\n    example &apos;for the two-match case&apos; do ... end\n  end      \nend</pre>\n\n<p>Basically, RSpec is a pleasure to work with, helps you to write the right kind of tests, and boasts excellent integration with <a href=\"http://rspec.rubyforge.org/tools/rake.html\">Rake</a> (Ruby-style &quot;Makefiles&quot;) and <a href=\"http://rspec.rubyforge.org/tools/rcov.html\">Rcov </a> (code coverage reports). I&apos;m so impressed with it that I am going to see how far I can morph my own Objective-C testing framework, <a href=\"http://test.wincent.com/\">WOTest</a>, towards the behaviour-driven development model.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Steve Jobs would love to <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/\">abolish DRM on Apple&apos;s music downloads</a>. Am I surprised that he feels this way? Not really. Am I surprised that he went on the record and said it to the public? Very much so. This is a gutsy move because he&apos;s built up a dominant position in the music downloads marketplace and then basically defying the public to challenge his &quot;allies&quot; (the record labels). This is going to make some serious waves. I hope that they end up actually turning the tide. Could this be a revolution?</p>\n\n<p>Why do I care? I personally don&apos;t mind the iTMS DRM because it doesn&apos;t really impact my fair-use rights in any way. But I&apos;d be happy to see it go because it would be good for Apple, and what&apos;s good for Apple is good for me seeing as I am both a consumer of Apple&apos;s products and I want to see them bring ever-better products to market, and a vendor within the Apple marketplace (selling software that runs on Apple operating systems). I&apos;ll bet that if the iTMS sold DRM-free tracks then Apple&apos;s already-brisk sales would positively sky-rocket.</p>\n\n<p>But I think there&apos;s an interesting question here: is there an analogy between DRM on music and copy-protection on software? I think there is, but the distribution models are currently different.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001147more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>Why it wouldn&apos;t work for software</h4>\n\n<p>Let me explain: when you download music from the iTMS it is protected by DRM; when you download software like <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">Synergy</a> it is protected by a serial number system.</p>\n\n<p>Jobs is basically saying that he&apos;d embrace a model in which you could download DRM-free music from the iTMS. Does that mean that I could or should start distributing software without any serial number system?</p>\n\n<p>I think the answer is no because the distribution models are different. Ask yourself this, do you think Jobs would advocate a system in which people could download music from the iTMS without paying for it? That is, that the music would be like shareware; you&apos;d download it and <em>then</em> pay for it. I don&apos;t think so...</p>\n\n<p>That&apos;s really the reason why Jobs&apos; proposal for DRM-free music downloads would work; because it&apos;s predicated on the distribution model being a pay-to-download one. Most Internet-distributed commercial software today does not use that model; it instead uses a pay-to-authenticate or a pay-to-unlock model, or a &quot;pay to switch from trial to full ownership&quot; model.</p>\n\n<p>I think if we switched to a pay-to-download model then yes, we could throw all our serial number and product activation schemes out the window. These systems limit piracy but never eradicate it completely. In an ideal implementation, a pay-to-download model would be approximately as effective in limiting the damage done by piracy. Instead of sharing patches, cracked versions and serial numbers, people would exchange the software itself. This is all too easy today thanks to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent\">BitTorrent</a> and the various torrent community sites and search engines, so the implementation would have to be carefully constructed if it were to deliver the same kinds of conversion rates (sale to downloads ratio).</p>\n\n<h4>Benefits of the pay-to-download model</h4>\n\n<p>You no longer have to spend time writing serial number systems, nor maintaining blacklists, nor engaging in any of the other ongoing anti-piracy police work that you must undertake when you rely on a serial number system. You no longer have to write code to support timed trial periods, or limited numbers of runs (which are easily defeated anyway).</p>\n\n<p>The extra time that has suddenly become available to you can be put towards new features and bug fixes, which ultimately pleases customers and drives sales.</p>\n\n<p>When there are no protection mechanisms you&apos;re freed of having to worry about keeping them secret. This removes one of the barriers to eventually open-sourcing your products. (I love open source; I&apos;d open source everything if I could figure out a way to make it financially viable.)</p>\n\n<p>Users can&apos;t lose their serial numbers if there aren&apos;t any serial numbers to lose. This is one less thing for them to worry about and it means that you as a developer will avoid the support costs related to helping customers find lost serial numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Being free of serial numbers can build good will with customers, and that&apos;s good for business. But you&apos;ll only build up that good will if you provide them with an experience that is as good or better than the experience that they currently get with serial numbers. Doing this well requires considerable thought.</p>\n\n<h4>Downsides to the pay-to-download model</h4>\n\n<p>You lose the convenience of building a single product which is a trial version which can be unlocked. You instead have to build a separate demonstration version with limited capabilities. Admittedly you can probably use pre-processor macros and conditional compilation to build both products from the same code base, but it&apos;s still two builds instead of one. And instead of testing one built product you&apos;ve got to test two.</p>\n\n<p>The same problem applies when it comes to rolling out updates. When someone running the trial version wants to check out a new version you can just point them at the download URL for the new trial. But what do you do when someone running the full version wants to upgrade? Do you provide unique URLs for each customer to discourage sharing? Do you provide incremental upgrade packages which can only be applied to full versions? How do you provide a smooth and hassle-free upgrade experience for paying customers without weakening the security of the distribution model too much?</p>\n\n<p>In the case of major, paid upgrades, how do you identify previous customers? Instead of requiring a serial number from a previous version what do you require? An email address? These change far too often.</p>\n\n<p>You can no longer distribute the full version of your software on magazine cover CDs, or give it away at conferences or user group meetings. This really isn&apos;t such a big deal, but it does mean that you&apos;ll have to invest time in making it very easy for people to upgrade to the full version of your application (ideally from within the application itself).</p>\n\n<p>Some of the time you save in maintaining copy protection technology must be spent developing the server-side support for the pay-to-download system itself. This means providing unique download URLs for each purchaser which should be made available to them immediately upon purchase. Once again, this should ideally be done from within the application itself. For obvious reasons, URLs should be both time-limited and the number of downloads should be restricted.</p>\n\n<p>You no longer have to worry about lost serial numbers but you instead have to worry about people who lose or delete their copy of the product whether due to hardware failure or some other cause. This requires you to develop a system which will mail purchasers with a new URL to download the software again.</p>\n\n<p>One of the disincentives to sharing serial numbers is that they can be loosely &quot;tied&quot; to the identity of the purchaser. &quot;<tt>steve@example.com</tt>&quot; is less likely to share the license that he purchased if it means that he has to hand out his email address along with the serial number. You lose some of this disincentive when you switch to the pay-to-download model, unless you can find some way of personalizing or watermarking each download on the fly. This is much easier said than done.</p>\n\n<h4>Update: 8 February 2007</h4>\n\n<p>Another viewpoint emailed to me by <a href=\" http://www.opinionatedbastard.com/archives/000748.html\">Pierce Wetter</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote><p>Note: I work for PACE (www.paceap.com/www.ilok.com)</p>\n<p>The other side of DRM, especially for software is that software companies\nalways forget the R in DRM. </p>\n<p>If you shell out $400 for a piece of software, and you lose the disk, how\ndo you prove that you used to own the software?</p>\n<p>Most insurance companies won&apos;t insure software.</p>\n<p>Something we&apos;ve learned over in iLok land is that when you start enabling\nfeatures purely for the end users (multiple licenses per dongle, secure\ntransfers of licenses, backups of licenses, etc.) users don&apos;t mind DRM so\nmuch. </p>\n<p>Perhaps its worth $.99/song for Apple to be effectively backing up every\nsong I own. (You can re-download your music library once/customer.)</p>\n<p>Just some thoughts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Just over a year ago I wrote about <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/01/spam_to_be_elim.php\">Bill Gates&apos; failed prediction</a> that spam would be &quot;solved&quot; by the beginning of 2006. Microsoft tried to deny the demonstrable failure of this prediction by redefining the meaning of the word &quot;solved&quot; in a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/01/spam_will_be_so.php\">way that does not bear inspection</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So it&apos;s time for my annual review of the spam situation (in fact, I&apos;m a few weeks late). What&apos;s the view on spam like from here a year later?</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001148more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h4>Countermeasures</h4>\n\n<p>During 2006 I <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/knowledge-base/archives/2006/06/clamping_down_o.php\">gradually toughened up my anti-spam arsenal</a> by introducing a number of new measures at the server level which reduce the amount of spam getting downloaded to the local machine and increase the likelihood that the spam which does get through will be tagged as such before it even hits Mail.app&apos;s filters:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tougher scoring on non-English messages.</li>\n<li>Automatic deletion of extremely high-scoring spam.</li>\n<li>Auto-whitelisting.</li>\n<li>Bayesian training.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I later took <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Combatting_spam\">further steps</a> at the server level:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Blocking_non-local_senders_for_local-only_recipients\">Blocking non-local senders for local-only recipients</a>.</li>\n<li>Conservative <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/DNS-based_blacklisting\">DNS-based blacklisting</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And at the policy level:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reducing the number of web-visible email addresses on sites that I control.</li>\n<li>Using easily cancellable addresses when providing email addresses to third parties.</li>\n<li>Migrating away from old addresses which receive a lot of spam to newer addresses.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Combatting_spam\">discussed here</a> these changes combined to significantly reduce the number of spam messages getting to my mail box each day; I don&apos;t have any hard figures for the entire period but the evidence I do have suggests that the number of spams thwarted by these measures is of the order of several hundred per day.</p>\n\n<h4>SpamSieve</h4>\n\n<p>Spam that does get through to the client level is largely handled by <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2005/11/spamsieve_one_y.php\">SpamSieve</a>. The current client-level statistics are as follows: </p>\n\n<pre>Filtered Mail\n190,575 Good Messages\n61,118 Spam Messages (24%)\n74 Spam Messages Per Day\n<br>\nSpamSieve Accuracy\n232 False Positives\n735 False Negatives (76%)\n99.6% Correct\n<br>\nCorpus\n2,986 Good Messages\n4,215 Spam Messages (59%)\n240,681 Total Words\n<br>\nRules\n1,029 Blocklist Rules\n5,126 Whitelist Rules\n<br>\nShowing Statistics Since\n10/11/2004 11:42</pre>\n\n<p>Observations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>67,000 good messages where received in the last year.</li>\n<li>46,000 spam messages where received in the last year.</li>\n<li>Spam now accounts for 24% of all mail <em>ever received</em> (since statistic recording began), up from 11% at the same time last year; of the messages received in the last year, nearly 41% were spam.</li>\n<li>There were only 48 false positives in the last year, and 378 false negatives. False negatives accounted for a larger proportion of the mistakes: 76%, up from 66% last year (this is an improvement because false positives are more undesirable than false negatives).</li>\n<li>Overall the accuracy of SpamSieve remained solid at 99.6%.</li>\n<li>SpamSieve&apos;s corpus of good messages grew by nearly 50%; the corpus of spam message nearly doubled.</li>\n<li>Likewise the number of rules in the blocklist doubled, and those in the whitelist nearly doubled.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Conclusions</h4>\n\n<p>Looking at these figures there&apos;s only one conclusion to be drawn: spam wasn&apos;t &quot;solved&quot; in 2006 and in my case it actually got much, much worse. This is especially true considering the number of spams that were stopped by the additional countermeasures which otherwise would have made it through and made things even worse.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the fact that spam is out of control, SpamSieve continues to be an effective measure of shielding the user from the annoyance of spam. I&apos;m troubled by less than one false positive per week, and about one false negative per day. The accuracy is good enough that I can mostly forget about spam most of the time; messages classified as spam by SpamSieve get routed to a folder called &quot;Zpam&quot;, which due to its alphabetization is almost perpetually out of side at the bottom of my folder listing (scrolled out of view). Out of sight, out of mind. I revise the contents of this folder about twice per week.</p>\n\n<p>So spam is getting worse but life is still good thanks to some good tools. I will be interested to see if the same trends continue in the coming year.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>A few days ago a <a href=\"http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070201160753532\">Groklaw article</a> drew my attention to the availability of <a href=\"http://iowaconsumercase.org/lc-8.html\">video footage</a> from Bill Gate&apos;s 1998 anti-trust case deposition. I promptly used <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/MPlayer\">MPlayer</a> to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Capturing_an_MMS_stream_to_disk\">capture the MMS streams to disk</a> and over the last few days I&apos;ve been allowing the footage (over a dozen hours) to play in the background while I work.</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s truly amazing. I&apos;d read <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/1998/11/17/gates_video_not_a_beautiful/print.html\">transcript excerpts</a> before but I&apos;d never heard or seen more than a few seconds of the actual video or audio footage.</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s astonishing to see Gates, surely an individual of well above average intelligence, petulantly throw up obstacle after obstacle in the path of David Boies (the attorney asking the questions), stalling, dodging questions, offering implausible explanations, claiming not to remember anything, bickering over the meaning of common words, and the really puzzling bit: doing all this as though he actually thought it would help his case. Of course it didn&apos;t; Microsoft was found guilty of repeatedly illegally abusing its monopoly position and the judge ordered that the company be split up. It&apos;s a shame that with the change of government in 2000 Microsoft wriggled off the hook.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, you really have to see it to believe it. It&apos;s so astounding that it&apos;s actually funny at times. I&apos;m including below an illustrative section from the transcript, one of my favorite parts.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001154more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<blockquote><p><strong>Boies:</strong> Okay. Now, let me go on to another paragraph and see whether you remember writing that or not. And that is the second paragraph, which reads, &quot;Apparently a lot of OEMs are bundling non-Microsoft browsers and coming up with offerings together with Internet Service providers that get displayed on their machines in a FAR&quot; and you&apos;ve capitalized each of the letters in far &quot;more prominent way than MSN or our Internet browser.&quot; Do you see that? </p>\n<p><strong>Gates:</strong> Uh-huh. </p>\n<p><strong>Boies:</strong> Did you write that sentence, Mr. Gates? </p>\n<p><strong>Gates:</strong> I don&apos;t remember, but I have no reason to doubt that I did. </p>\n<p><strong>Boies:</strong> Do you remember what you were thinking when you wrote that sentence or what you meant when you wrote that sentence? </p>\n<p><strong>Gates:</strong> No. </p>\n<p><strong>Boies:</strong> Do you remember that in January, 1996, a lot of OEMs were bundling non-Microsoft browsers? </p>\n<p><strong>Gates:</strong> I&apos;m not sure. </p>\n<p><strong>Boies:</strong> What were the non-Microsoft browsers that you were concerned about in January of 1996? </p>\n<p><strong>Gates:</strong> What&apos;s the question? You&apos;re trying to get me to recall what other browsers I was thinking about when I wrote that sentence? </p>\n<p><strong>Boies:</strong> No, because you&apos;ve told me that you don&apos;t know what you were thinking about when you wrote that sentence. </p>\n<p><strong>Gates:</strong> Right. </p>\n<p><strong>Boies:</strong> What I&apos;m trying to do is get you to tell me what non-Microsoft browsers you were concerned about in January of 1996. If it had been only one, I probably would have used the name of it. Instead I seem to be using the term non-Microsoft browsers. My question is what non-Microsoft browsers were you concerned about in January of 1996? </p>\n<p><strong>Gates:</strong> I&apos;m sure -- what&apos;s the question? Is it -- are you asking me about when I wrote this e-mail or what are you asking me about? </p>\n<p><strong>Boies:</strong> I&apos;m asking you about January of 1996. </p>\n<p><strong>Gates:</strong> That month? </p>\n<p><strong>Boies:</strong> Yes, sir. </p>\n<p><strong>Gates:</strong> And what about it? </p>\n<p><strong>Boies:</strong> What non-Microsoft browsers were you concerned about in January of 1996? </p>\n<p><strong>Gates:</strong> I don&apos;t know what you mean &quot;concerned.&quot; </p>\n<p><strong>Boies:</strong> What is it about the word &quot;concerned&quot; that you don&apos;t understand? </p>\n<p><strong>Gates:</strong> I&apos;m not sure what you mean by it. </p>\n<p><strong>Boies:</strong> Is- </p>\n<p><strong>Gates:</strong> Is there a document where I use that term? </p>\n<p><strong>Boies:</strong> Is the term &quot;concerned&quot; a term that you&apos;re familiar with in the English language? </p>\n<p><strong>Gates:</strong> Yes. </p>\n<p><strong>Boies:</strong> Does it have a meaning that you&apos;re familiar with? </p>\n<p><strong>Gates:</strong> Yes. </p>\n<p><strong>Boies:</strong> Using the word &quot;concerned&quot; -- consistent with the normal meaning that it has in the English language, what Microsoft -- or what non-Microsoft browsers were you concerned about in January of 1996? </p>\n<p><strong>Gates:</strong> Well, I think I would have been concerned about Internet Explorer, what was going on with it.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Astonishing. Like watching a clever but severely affected autistic child.</p>\n\n<h4>Update: 15 February 2007</h4>\n\n<p>Disappointingly, the <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070214-8845.html\">case has been settled out of court</a> (<a href=\"http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/02/14/1844252\">via Slashdot</a>). I don&apos;t know how many millions Microsoft has agreed to cough up but it will no doubt be chicken feed for them, just as the measly coupons that will make it into consumer&apos;s hands will seem like chicken feed to them too.</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve already had a couple of requests to redistribute the deposition videos &#x2014; either uploading them to YouTube or posting DVDs &#x2014; but I&apos;m afraid the answer will have to be &quot;no&quot; to all such requests. It would just be too much work, take too much time, and I am unsure of the legality of it. Try checking the comments on the <a href=\"http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070201160753532\">original Groklaw story</a>; I know at least some of the participants there talked about making the videos or audio-only versions available in a number of forms (BitTorrent, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Content_Distribution_Network\">Coral Cache</a> etc).</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>In a previous article about <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/01/writing_a_parse.php\">writing a parser generator in Ruby</a> I promised to talk about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree\">Abstract Syntax Trees</a>. The problem with the parsers previously described is that the literal results (strings arranged in a hierarchical, ordered tree with the aid of arrays) are not very information-rich and they are difficult to work with.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001159more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>Take, for example, the statement:</p>\n\n<pre>foo = bar + 1</pre>\n\n<p>After tokenizing this is represented in the following way:</p>\n\n<pre>[ &apos;foo&apos;, &apos;=&apos;, [ &apos;bar&apos;, &apos;+&apos;, &apos;1&apos; ]]</pre>\n\n<p>Although this accurately reflects the structure of the source, it is cumbersome to work with. It is not very semantically rich; the only way you can tell that it is an assignment expression is by looking at the second term (the <tt>=</tt> operator). Likewise, the nested addition expression can only be identified by looking at the second term in that (the <tt>+</tt> operator). It also contains redundant information; the operators themselves wouldn&apos;t even need to be included if the larger structures were appropriately labelled as an assignment and an addition expression respectively.</p>\n\n<h4>Omitting tokens that aren&apos;t necessary to convey semantics</h4>\n\n<p>Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) address these concerns by removing tokens that don&apos;t apport any semantic information and by encoding the types of the expressions within the structure of the tree itself. We could do this by using classes:</p>\n\n<pre>class Expression; end # nothing interesting here, yet\n<br>\nclass AssignmentExpression &lt; Expression\n  attr_accessor :target, :value\n  def initialize(target, value)\n    @target, @value = [target, value]\n  end\nend\n<br>\nclass AdditionExpression &lt; Expression\n  attr_accessor :left_expression, :right_expression\n  def initialize(left_expression, right_expression)\n    @left_expression, @right_expression = [left_expression, right_expression]\n  end\nend</pre>\n\n<p>After parsing we would end up with an AST containing an <tt>AssignmentExpression</tt> object. The <tt>target</tt> would be <tt>foo</tt> and the <tt>value</tt> would be an <tt>AdditionExpression</tt>, which would have <tt>bar</tt> and <tt>1</tt> as its <tt>left_expression</tt> and <tt>right_expression</tt> respectively. The nice thing about using classes to represent nodes in an AST is that you can easily add custom behaviour to them; for example, the <tt>AdditionExpression</tt> class could easily be &quot;taught&quot; how to perform additions.</p>\n\n<h4>A syntax for skipping tokens</h4>\n\n<p>In order to make the production of ASTs easier we need a syntax for conveniently &quot;skipping&quot; tokens. By this I mean tokens that are expected to be present and which should be consumed during parsing, but which shouldn&apos;t end up in the AST. We&apos;ll use a syntax much like the one used for defining <tt>optional</tt> tokens in a sequence:</p>\n\n<pre>rule :bracket_expression, &apos;(&apos;.skip &amp; :bracket_content &amp; &apos;)&apos;.skip</pre>\n\n<p>The <tt>skip</tt> method is used here to indicate that each corresponding parslet must match, that it will consume its input, but that the parslet will produce no output in the AST. Ultimately only the &quot;bracket content&quot; winds up in the AST because that&apos;s the part we&apos;re interested in.</p>\n\n<h4>The array problem</h4>\n\n<p>The design thus far has adhered to some conventions in the name of simplicity. Consider an expression like the following:</p>\n\n<pre>&apos;foo&apos;.one_or_more</pre>\n\n<p>In the name of simplicity this parslet will return an array (<tt>[&apos;foo&apos;, &apos;foo&apos;, &apos;foo&apos;]</tt>) if multiple matches are found but will return a single string (<tt>&apos;foo&apos;</tt>) if only one match is found. That is, in the single-match case a simplification is being made to make the parse results easier to work with; we could have returned an array with a single element (<tt>[&apos;foo&apos;]</tt>) but returning a single string is generally more convenient for the person invoking the parslet.</p>\n\n<p>But what happens when we want to parse something like a comma-separated list?</p>\n\n<pre>foo, bar, abc, xyz</pre>\n\n<p>Note that we have four words but only three commas. The first three words are followed by a comma and some whitespace but the last word is not. Or to put it another way, the first word is isolated but the last three words are preceded by a comma and whitespace. We could try to parse this using the following parslet sequence:</p>\n\n<pre>/\\w+/ &amp; (/\\s*,\\s*/.skip &amp; /\\w+/).zero_or_more</pre>\n\n<p>In natural language this means we&apos;re looking to parse &quot;a word followed by zero or more other words preceded by a comma with optional whitespace&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the simplifications already described above, this will yield a single element (<tt>&apos;foo&apos;</tt>) in the one-match case and a two-element array (<tt>[&apos;foo&apos;, &apos;bar&apos;]</tt>) in the two-match case. But in the three and four match cases things break down and we get results which are not in a very usable form (for example, <tt>[&apos;foo&apos;, [&apos;bar&apos;, &apos;abc&apos;, &apos;xyz&apos;]]</tt>; note the nested array). The undesirable nesting takes place because the <tt>zero_or_more</tt> construct itself returns an array when there are multiple matches.</p>\n\n<p>There is no way for the parser to &quot;know&quot; what our intentions are here. Are we interested in the <em>contents</em> of the array (multiple objects), or are we after a single container object (the array itself)? The solution is to define another pseudo-operator to explicitly indicate when we&apos;re interested in the contents of an array rather than the container itself:</p>\n\n<pre>/\\w+/ &gt;&gt; (/\\s*,\\s*/.skip &amp; /\\w+/).zero_or_more</pre>\n\n<p><tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> is chosen because it has a similar precedence to <tt>&amp;</tt> (slightly higher in fact) and it is not already implemented by the <tt>String</tt> or <tt>Array</tt> classes. This pseudo-operator makes use of a <tt>ParsletSequence</tt> subclass, <tt>ParsletMerge</tt>, which takes array results on the right hand side and &quot;merges&quot; their contents into the array on the left hand side. So instead of <tt>[&apos;foo&apos;, [&apos;bar&apos;, &apos;abc&apos;, &apos;xyz&apos;]]</tt> we get what we actually wanted in this case: <tt>[&apos;foo&apos;, &apos;bar&apos;, &apos;abc&apos;, &apos;xyz&apos;]</tt>.</p>\n\n<h4>Defining AST nodes</h4>\n\n<p>We also need a convenient way for creating node classes for use in the AST. For this we design an abstract <tt>Node</tt> superclass and equip it with a factory method, <tt>subclass</tt>, that churns out custom <tt>Node</tt> subclasses. We could create an <tt>Expression</tt> class using:</p>\n\n<pre>Node.subclass(&apos;Expression&apos;) # passing in the subclass name as a String\nNode.subclass(:Expression) # passing in the subclass name as a Symbol</pre>\n\n<p>We could then go ahead and create our <tt>Expression</tt> subclasses; note how the <tt>Expression</tt> constant has been set and gives us access to the newly created parent class:</p>\n\n<pre>Expression.subclass(:AssignmentExpression, Walrus::Grammar, :target, :value)\nExpression.subclass(:AdditionExpression, Walrus::Grammar, :left_expression, :right_expression)</pre>\n\n<p>The second parameter in these calls is the namespace in which we wish to create these <tt>Node</tt> subclasses (<tt>Walrus::Grammar</tt> in this example); this allows us to define multiple grammars without having to worry about clashes with <tt>Node</tt> subclasses between grammars in the event that you want to have more inside the same running process. We can now create new node instances and access their contents as follows:</p>\n\n<pre>addition = AdditionExpression.new(&apos;bar&apos;, &apos;1&apos;)\nassignment = AssignmentExpression.new(&apos;foo&apos;, addition)\nassignment.target         # &apos;foo&apos;\nassignment.value          #  AdditionExpression: @left_expression = &apos;bar&apos;, @right_expression = &apos;1&apos;\naddition.left_expression  # &apos;bar&apos;\naddition.right_expression # &apos;1&apos;</pre>\n\n<p>Defining AST node classes can be made even easier by adding some convenience shorthand methods to the <tt>Grammar</tt> class which automatically take care of passing the appropriate namespace to the <tt>subclass</tt> method:</p>\n\n<pre># create a new Node subclass called Expression:\nnode :expression, :node\n<br>\n# or simply (Node is assumed to be the superclass if no second parameter present):\nnode :expression\n<br>\n# specify that the &quot;addition_expression&quot; rule should produce a node of the AdditionExpression class:\nproduction :addition_expression, :addition_expression\n<br>\n# or simply (AdditionExpression is assumed here if missing):\nproduction :addition_expression\n<br>\n# create a subclass and assign it to a rule at the same time:\nproduction :assignment_expression.build(:expression, :target, :value)</pre>\n\n<p>So how might this look in the context of a real grammar? Here&apos;s a simple grammar that can parse assignment and addition expressions like <tt>foo=1</tt>, <tt>bar=baz</tt> and <tt>abc+1</tt>, as well as allowing expressions to be nested (<tt>foo=bar+1</tt>):</p>\n\n<pre>starting_symbol :expression\n<br>\n# terminal tokens\nrule            :identifier,      /[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*/\nproduction      :identifier.build(:node)\nrule            :integer_literal, /[0-9]+/\nproduction      :integer_literal.build(:node)\n<br>\n# expressions\nrule            :expression,      :assignment_expression | :addition_expression | :identifier | :integer_literal\nnode            :expression\nrule            :assignment_expression, :identifier &amp; &apos;=&apos;.skip &amp; :expression\nproduction      :assignment_expression.build(:expression, :target, :value)\nrule            :addition_expression,   (:identifier | :integer_literal) &amp; &apos;+&apos;.skip &amp; :expression\nproduction      :addition_expression.build(:expression, :summee, :summor)</pre>\n\n<h4>Gobbling up whitespace</h4>\n\n<p>One of the problems with my first example above (<tt>foo = bar + 1</tt>) is that it simplifies things by not taking whitespace into consideration. To correctly parse such a statement the parser needs to be able to handle optional whitespace between the tokens. In the comma-separated list example above the included regular expression explicitly consumed optional whitespace between the list items, but ideally you should be able to write grammars without having to explicitly insert optional whitespace parslets between every item in a sequence. We do this by using the <tt>skipping</tt> directive to define an inter-parslet whitespace &quot;gobbler&quot; that will be used within sequences and repetitions in the event that parsing fails:</p>\n\n<pre>rule     :whitespace, /\\s+/\nskipping :whitespace</pre>\n\n<p>This allows combinations like:</p>\n\n<pre>&apos;foo&apos; &amp; &apos;=&apos; &amp; &apos;bar&apos;</pre>\n\n<p>To match strings like these:</p>\n\n<pre>foo=bar\nfoo = bar\nfoo= bar\n   foo = bar</pre>\n\n<p>Internally, the parslet sequence object tries to match the three components, <tt>foo</tt>, <tt>=</tt> and <tt>bar</tt>. If there is a failure trying to pass any of the three components, the parslet sequence will try running the &quot;skipping&quot; parslet (which consumes any intervening whitespace and throws it away) and then retries the failed component. My current implementation is fairly conservative: it only engages this fallback strategy inside parslet sequences and parslet repetitions. I may later apply it to other types of parslet and parslet combinations.</p>\n</div></div>",

I say &quot;gave in&quot; because I couldn&apos;t really justify purchasing yet another text editor when I already had a costly license for <a href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/\">BBEdit</a> (still my preferred tool for HTML editing); <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/support/mac101/work/23/\">TextEdit</a> is free, comes with Mac OS X, and is great for bashing out very quick and dirty plain text documents and notes; and <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/xcode/\">Xcode</a> is free and by far my favorite editor for working with Objective-C code (with excellent Code sense integration, split editor views, great global &quot;find in project&quot; interface and lots of other great things).</p>\n\n<p>Basically, I have no &quot;need&quot; whatsoever for yet another text editor. </p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I&apos;ve looked at TextMate various times over the last few months. Lately with all the Ruby editing I&apos;ve been doing I&apos;ve been spending hours each day looking at a TextMate window. This is because there is no viable IDE for Ruby on Mac OS X at this time. I did try <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/\">Eclipse</a> with the <a href=\"http://rubyeclipse.sourceforge.net/\">Ruby Development Tools</a> but I just couldn&apos;t stomach such a horrible, bloated Java application in which the debugger didn&apos;t even work properly (at least, not for me: I couldn&apos;t set breakpoints). When will Java applications look and perform like &quot;native&quot; Cocoa apps? &quot;Never&quot; is my guess...</p>\n\n<p>So lately I&apos;ve been using TextMate for editing Ruby source code, and I&apos;ve been hitting Command-R to run my specs. It&apos;s not a true &quot;IDE&quot; but the work flow could be worse. When I need to debug I&apos;ve been <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Interactive_debugging_with_ruby-debug\">doing it from the command-line</a> using <tt>rdebug</tt>.</p>\n\n<p>I finally decided to throw some money Allan&apos;s way today for the following reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The very liberal trial policy which has allowed me to try out different versions of TextMate on many different occasions over the course of the last year.</li>\n<li>Fair price; 39&#x20AC; seems a fair enough charge for a reliable, extensible text editor in which you do a lot of work.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://macromates.com/license_policy\">Up front</a>, fair upgrade policy: free upgrades for a year, and 2.0 will be free.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://macromates.com/ticket/show?ticket_id=11746E04\">CamelCase word movement</a> using Control plus the arrow keys was added a while back, I just didn&apos;t know about it; something I used literally hundreds of times <em>per hour</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So I decided to get a license. I don&apos;t need one but I feel a lot better about giving Allan my 39&#x20AC; than I would about given even one red cent to the master-minds behind the <a href=\"http://macheist.com/\">heist</a> scam.</p>\n\n<p>Things I&apos;d still like to see:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://macromates.com/ticket/show?ticket_id=F4398B73\">Split editor views</a>.</li>\n<li>A more Xcode-like find-in-project window.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thing I don&apos;t care about at all:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lack of CodeSense: that&apos;s what Xcode is for.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div id=\"a001175more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>I&apos;ve previously written about writing a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/01/writing_a_parse.php\">basic parser generator</a> in Ruby and then <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/02/abstract_syntax.php\">adding support</a> for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree\">Abstract Syntax Trees</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/01/writing_a_parse.php\">first article</a> I noted:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Although I didn&apos;t know it when I started, I was writing a parser generator that would produce a parser based on a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar\">Parsing Expression Grammar</a> (PEG).</blockquote>\n\n<p>Parsing Expression Grammars go hand-in-hand with so-called &quot;packrat parsers&quot;. Both terms were coined by <a href=\"http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/\">Bryan Ford</a> in the research work he did for his <a href=\"http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/packrat/thesis/\">Masters thesis</a>. The core idea behind packrat parsers is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization\">memoization</a>, the storage of intermediate parse results to avoid exponential increases in parse time caused by backtracking. Packrat parsers should always be able to operate in linear time (proportional to the length of their input), not exponential time (like <del>some</del> <a href=\"http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html\">most regular expression implementations</a>, for instance).</p>\n\n<p>Ruby rocks, and I&apos;ve got quite a clean Object-Oriented design in my parser generator, so I was able to add automatic, optional memoization in only a few hours today (and most of that time was spent thinking rather than coding). Here are some initial performance numbers.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001184more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>Memoization avoids exponential backtracking by trading storage (memory use) for speed. Every intermediate parse result is &quot;remembered&quot; in case it is needed again in the future, requiring more and more memory as the size of the input text grows, and also incurring some processing overhead (to &quot;remember&quot; the results and look them up as required). This processing overhead, however, should be roughly linear rather than exponential.</p>\n\n<p>My implementation memoizes all kinds of &quot;results&quot;; perhaps &quot;outcomes&quot; would be a better term. Outcomes may include raised exceptions, thrown symbols, literal strings, arrays, or AST nodes may be returned. What this means is that basically all possible success and failure outcomes are captured.</p>\n\n<h4>Worst case results</h4>\n\n<p>So far I only have worst case results: extremely short inputs from my behaviour specs which don&apos;t really ever allow backtracking to get too far out of control. With these inputs parsing is actually slower with memoizing turned on. I&apos;ll be updating these results once I&apos;ve tested with larger inputs.</p>\n\n<p>The &quot;worst of the worst case scenarios&quot; is running the entire spec suite for Walrus. The input texts in the specs at this point in time are extremely small and the grammars used to parse them are also tiny, the minimum possible to be able to test for the desired behaviour. As a result there is relatively little backtracking going on.</p>\n\n<p>There are 180 specs in all. Running all of the specs without memoizing turned on there are 15,585 parse events in all in 2.0 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>When memoizing is turned on the execution time goes up by 25% (to 2.5 seconds) even though the total number of parse events is reduced to 12,183. Of these events, 11,627 were considered to be &quot;new&quot; (never seen before by the memoizer) and were stored in the cache; an additional 556 events were recognized by the memoizer as &quot;seen before&quot; and so the results could be returned from the cache rather than re-performing them. Note that this &quot;short-circuting&quot; didn&apos;t just save the 556 events that were identified as &quot;seen before&quot;; there were an additional 3,402 parse events which didn&apos;t have to be re-executed because the &quot;short-circuiting&quot; means that subsequent events depending on the 556 matches didn&apos;t have to be executed either.</p>\n\n<p>On such small inputs memory usage is still well within reasonable limits so that lack of speed in the memoized parsing is almost entirely due to additional set-up and maintenance costs.</p>\n\n<p>A slightly better test scenario, at least in theory, is running a subset of he spec suit consisting of tests of only the Walrus grammar and excluding the specs for the parser generator itself. These specs are closer to real world usage because the grammar itself is orders of magnitude more complex, although the input texts are still currently very small. Once the grammar is complete I will publish results with much bigger input texts.</p>\n\n<p>The smaller scale test contains only 21 specs. Running them without memoizing turned on yields 12,773 parse events which execute in about 1.37 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>With memoizing turned on the execution time increases by about 30% (to 1.8 seconds). This is slightly worse slow-down than that seen in the full test suite. The total number of parse events is 10,233, a saving of about 20% (similar to in the full test suite). Of these events, 9,693 were considered to be &quot;new&quot; and 540 were recognized by the memoizer as &quot;seen before&quot;. The number of &quot;seen before&quot; events was relatively larger in this case (5% compared with 4.5%) and the total number of &quot;short circuited&quot; events (all &quot;seen before&quot; events and their dependent events which would otherwise have been executed) is slightly smaller (24% versus 25%).</p>\n\n<h4>Limitations</h4> \n\n<p>These numbers refer to the initial memoizing implementation, developedin a few hours with absolutely no attempt at optimization. It may be possible to speed up the implementation after profiling and analysis. On the other hand, it may be that the performance numbers change for large inputs.</p>\n\n<p>One of the limitations of this particular packrat implementation is that it is not as granular as it theoretically could be. That is, whereas a theoretical ideal packrat parser would operate at the character level, the current implementation operates at the level of entire tokens (or sequences of tokens). Whereas a character-level implementation would be able to recognize the common roots of strings like &quot;foobar&quot; and &quot;foobaz&quot;, the token-level implementation sees them as distinct tokens.</p>\n\n<p>Experimentation would be required to determine whether this is a disadvantage or not. A character-level implementation could pinpoint parslet/coordinate pairs with greater granularity, but it would also require more entries in the memoizing cache and the overhead might be higher because the memoizing code itself would be called more often.</p>\n\n<p>I will post more data when it becomes available.</p>\n\n<h4>Update: 16 February 2007</h4>\n\n<p>Some <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/02/updated_packrat.php\">more numbers</a>.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>The packrat performance numbers I <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/02/putting_the_pac.php\">published yesterday</a> were deficient in a couple of ways. Firstly, performance was a little slow; I&apos;ve been able to improve this somewhat with some minor changes. Secondly, the &quot;parse event&quot; numbers with memoizing turned off were inaccurate (too low), leading to an understatement of the number of events &quot;saved&quot; due to memoization; I&apos;ve now corrected this as well.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001188more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>In a stunning display of lack of attention to detail (and to my &quot;to do&quot; list), <del>almost</del> all of my <tt>Parslet</tt>, <tt>ParsletCombination</tt> and <tt>Predicate</tt> classes were lacking the <tt>hash</tt> and <tt>eql?</tt> methods needed to make them suitable for use as keys in a hash. This meant that in many cases previously captured intermediate results were being overlooked and parsing operations were being redone.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to correcting this oversight I also took the time to tighten up the code in a number of places, storing the hashes in instance variables rather than re-calculating them on demand.</p>\n\n<p>The base figures we started with yesterday:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Total number of parse events (without memoization):</strong> 15,585 (understated; the real number is slightly higher)</li>\n<li><strong>Total number of parse events (with memoization):</strong> 12,183</li>\n<li><strong>Cache hits:</strong> 556</li>\n<li><strong>Cache misses:</strong> 11,627</li>\n<li><strong>Execution time (without memoization)</strong>: 2.0 seconds</li>\n<li><strong>Execution time (without memoization)</strong>: 2.5 seconds</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After adding <tt>hash</tt> and <tt>eql?</tt> methods to my parslet classes the number of cache hits doubled and cache misses fell by nearly 1,000. After these changes processing was slightly faster (2.4 seconds). Continuing to add methods to my parslet combination classes I was able to shave off another 100 misses and get the execution time down to just over 2.3 seconds. The final results were as follows; I expect the improvements to be more notable on larger data sets (and I haven&apos;t even started profiling yet):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Total number of parse events (without memoization):</strong> 15,834</li>\n<li><strong>Total number of parse events (with memoization):</strong> 11,701 (4% improvement)</li>\n<li><strong>Cache hits:</strong> 1,084 (95% improvement)</li>\n<li><strong>Cache misses:</strong> 10,566 (9% improvement)</li>\n<li><strong>Execution time (without memoization)</strong>: 2.018 seconds</li>\n<li><strong>Execution time (without memoization)</strong>: 2.368 seconds (5% improvement)</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>",

    "file": "content/blog/parser-generator-update",
    "html": "<p>One of the things that&apos;s been so good about <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/01/writing_a_parse.php\">writing the parser generator</a> <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/02/abstract_syntax.php\">for Walrus</a> is that it has made the code much more flexible, much easier to develop iteratively. In my original design I had a hand-coded parser and a simple grammar that imposed a number of restrictions to make the parser&apos;s job easier:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There were only three characters with special meaning, <tt>#</tt>, <tt>$</tt> and <tt>\\</tt>.</li>\n<li>The parser was strictly line-oriented:\n  <ul>\n    <li>Comments extended to the end of the line as did directives.</li>\n    <li>As a special case, a comment could follow a directive on the same line.</li>\n    <li>Directives could not span lines.</li>\n    <li>Placeholders couldn&apos;t span lines either.</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ul> \n\n<p>The notion of &quot;what is a Ruby expression&quot; was extremely simplified. The basic idea was that when expecting a Ruby expression the lexer would drop into a mode where it would blindly consume characters until it hit something that marked the end of the expression; it would do this without analysing the internal structure of the expression in anything but the simplest of ways.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001195more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h3>Manually parsing Ruby expressions</h3>\n\n<p>To illustrate, consider the case of parsing a placeholder:</p>\n\n<pre>$my_placeholder(foo)</pre>\n\n<p>On seeing the initial <tt>$</tt> the lexer knew that a placeholder was coming and so looked for an identifier (in this case, <tt>my_placeholder</tt>). On hitting the opening bracket the lexer new that a parameter list containing zero or more Ruby expressions was coming, but it could really only prepare itself for three eventualities:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Hitting a <tt>)</tt> would mean that the end of the parameter list</li>\n<li>Hitting a <tt>,</tt> would mean the end of one parameter and the beginning of another</li>\n<li>&quot;Everything else&quot; would be part of an parameter expression</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I didn&apos;t want to write a full Ruby lexer/parser given that Ruby is such a complex language (in the syntactic sense). In order to be able to parse basic structures like Array and Hash literals I had to put in some special case handling. In practice while lexing a Ruby expression the process looked something like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Keep going until you hit something that marks the end of an expression (<tt>)</tt>, <tt>,</tt>, or the end of the current line)</li>\n<li>If you hit a <tt>,</tt> start scanning a new expression</li>\n<li>If you hit a <tt>[</tt> you&apos;re inside an array and <tt>,</tt> no longer marks the end of the current expression; scan recursively for zero or more Ruby expressions; finally, <tt>]</tt> marks the end of the array.</li>\n<li>Similar rules applied for hashes (looking for <tt>{</tt>) and bracketed expressions (looking for &quot;<tt>(</tt>&quot;).</li>\n<li>Different rules applied inside string literals (where <tt>[</tt>, <tt>(</tt>, <tt>{</tt> and their counterparts lost their special meaning) and escaping meant that <tt>&quot;</tt> or <tt>&apos;</tt> didn&apos;t necessarily mark the end of the string due to escaping.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In short, even unsophisticated parsing of Ruby expressions soon lead to an ugly rats nest of imprecise generalizations, exceptions and code.</p>\n\n<h3>Parsing Ruby expressions with the parser generator</h3>\n\n<p>The experience using a parser generator couldn&apos;t be more different. I was able to writing half a dozen grammar rules in a few minutes to handle string literals, array literals, hash literals, symbol literals, constants, identifiers, message sends, assignment expressions, addition expressions and so forth. I spent much more time writing specifications to confirm the behaviour of the parser than I did writing the actual rules which generated it. Having written the basic rules, things like arbitrarily deep and complex nesting worked automatically.</p>\n\n<p>At the beginning I&apos;d said, &quot;I don&apos;t want to invest any time writing a Ruby lexer/parser&quot;. But after writing the parser generator I was able to create a useful subset of such a lexer/parser in only a few minutes; only a subset but already much, much more powerful than my hand-coded parser ever would have been.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from being quicker and less error prone than hand-coded the parser, the generated parser has the advantage that it actually has some kind of &quot;understanding&quot; of the internal structure of a Ruby expression because it has analysed the internal structure of it rather than pseudo-blindly gobbling it up. That is, it doesn&apos;t just attempt to consume input and &quot;recognize&quot; stuff that is a Ruby expression; it actually produces an Abstract Syntax Tree which describes the components within the expression, describes what they are and the relationships among them. The dumb alternative is far more likely to accept faulty input that isn&apos;t really a valid Ruby expression; further down the track when you try to actually use this input you&apos;ll find that it doesn&apos;t work as you expect. The more rigorous alternative, on the other hand, is more likely to catch faulty input before you try to use it.</p>\n\n<h3>Performance update</h3>\n\n<p>As the grammar complexity increases, the speed gap between the memoizing and non-memoizing cases closes. I&apos;ve now got 202 specs: with memoizing the parser takes 6.411 seconds to run them; without memoizing the runtime is 5.162 seconds. That&apos;s with quite short input texts; I expect the gap to close even more as the input size grows.</p>\n\n<p>This performance improvement comes at a time when I had made <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2007/02/walrus_r44_6_items_changed.php\">some changes</a> imposing stricter identification of cache hits and misses in the memoizer (making hits less likely but making sure that the parse tree generated with memoizing turned on really is identical to that produced with memoizing turned off). At the moment a run yields 3,956 hits and 26,749 misses. I&apos;ll be interested to watch those numbers when I try large input texts.</p>\n\n<h3>Walrus grammar enhancements</h3>\n\n<p>The power of the parser generator has allowed me to enrich the allowed syntax in the grammar in a way that would be awkward if I were still using a hand-coded parser.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in a few minutes I was able to extend the placeholder syntax to allow a &quot;long form&quot;:</p>\n\n<pre>${foo}</pre>\n\n<p>In addition to the existing form:</p>\n\n<pre>$foo</pre>\n\n<p>The &quot;long form&quot; is useful in those cases where you might want a placeholder to be immediately followed by raw text with no intervening whitespace:</p>\n\n<pre>${foo}bar</pre>\n\n<p>With the hand-coded parser this would have required painful rewriting but with the parser generator, this was a simple matter of tweaking the rules. And being an augmentation of the syntax rather than a compatibility-breaking change of the old syntax all of my old specs continued to pass and I only needed to write new specs confirming the behaviour under the alternative syntax.</p>\n\n<p>Other stuff that was quick to add:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Explicit directive end markers (for example, <tt>#silent foo#</tt>) which allow you to embed directives within the flow of a single line; this syntax would have been difficult to implement with the hand-coded parser because of the previous design decision that directives should always extend to the end of the current line.</li>\n<li>Ability to span directives across multiple lines using the backslash at the end of the line as a &quot;line continuation&quot; marker.</li>\n<li>Ability to specify multiple semi-colon separated expressions in <tt>#silent</tt> directives.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Then there was other stuff that I never would even have attempted with the hand-written parser, such as multiline comments, and nested ones at that.</p>\n\n<h3>Grammar specification improvements</h3>\n\n<p>In addition to the improvements to the Walrus grammar itself, I made a couple of changes that makes writing grammars a little more pleasant.</p>\n\n<h4><tt>ParsletRepetitionDefault</tt></h4>\n\n<p>First up, I made a <tt>ParsletRepetitionDefault</tt> class that makes it easy to specify what value should be returned if an <tt>optional</tt> component is not present. By default, these optional structures are simply omitted from the output if they are not present, but with <tt>ParsletRepetitionDefault</tt> you can state exactly what object should be returned as a placeholder if the component is missing.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the following rules. In the first example there is no problem even if the optional <tt>parameter_list</tt> is not present in the input. The fact that another component follows the optional one ensures that at least <em>something</em> will be returned by the parser (in this case an empty array) and so there will be <em>something</em> to populate the Abstract Syntax Tree.</p>\n\n<p>In the second example there is no trailing component so we must employ an ugly hack, a &quot;no-op&quot; component (an empty regular expression) that as a side effect ensures that something will be returned (again an empty array) even when the optional <tt>method_parameter_list</tt> is missing.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the third example demonstrates the use of the new <tt>ParsletRepetitionDefault</tt> class. The <tt>optional</tt> qualifier can now take an optional parameter specifying what should be returned as a placeholder in the event that the optional component is absent. This is much better than the hacky alternative because it is transparent and clearly shows the intention behind the rule.</p>\n\n<pre># not needed\nrule :super_with_parentheses, &apos;#super&apos;.skip &amp; :parameter_list.optional &amp; :directive_end\n<br>\n# hack\nrule :method_with_parentheses, :identifier &amp; :method_parameter_list.optional &amp; //\n<br>\n# elegant\nrule :method_with_parentheses, :identifier &amp; :method_parameter_list.optional([])</pre>\n\n<p>The object-oriented design of the system made it very quick to add this behaviour. I decided to subclass <tt>ParsletRepetition</tt> rather than augmenting that class itself with optional behaviour so as to keep it simple. Parsers are complex systems of multiple parts: I&apos;d rather have a complex system made up of simple parts than a complex system made up of complex parts.</p>\n\n<h4>Ability to override skipping parslet for specific rules</h4>\n\n<p>Rather than just specifying a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/02/abstract_syntax.php\">default parslet</a> for skipping between tokens, you can now override that on a per-rule basis. This means either specifying a different parslet for that rule or specifying <tt>nil</tt> to entirely turn off skipping for that rule.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, consider a scenario in which you want your default inter-token parslet to skip over newlines and whitespace (where &quot;whitespace&quot; is spaces, tabs but not newlines). Then imagine a rule where you want to skip only whitespace not newlines. The solution is to override the skipping token for that rule. I&apos;ve used this in the Walrus grammar for parsing directives (which should not span multiple lines unless an explicit line continuation marker is used) and for parsing things like multi-line comments and string literals (where I don&apos;t want any skipping at all).</p>\n</div></div>",

On the other hand, names like Omni, Karelia and Ambrosia are much more distinctive and I think they make for better brands.</p>\n\n<p>One thing, at least, is that independent Mac software vendors haven&apos;t yet been influenced by the &quot;Web 2.0&quot; style of naming: intentional misspelling, lacking capitalization (flickr, digg), number-plus-noun (37 signals) and countless other &quot;me too!&quot; examples.</p>\n\n<h4>Update</h4>\n\n<p>Daniel Jalkut (of Red Sweater) contacted me with a link to <a href=\"http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/187/adjective-noun-software\">his own Web 2.0 application</a> which enables you to generate a company name from your browser without the need to roll up your sleeves and learn the hard-to-find-documentation-on <tt>NSRandomAdjective</tt> and <tt>NSRandomNoun</tt> APIs mentioned above.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>I <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2007/02/walrus_r51_3_items_changed.php\">just added</a> &quot;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document\">here document</a>&quot; support to Walrus.</p>\n\n<p>This is an extension to the normal syntax for the <tt>raw</tt> directive:</p>\n\n<pre>#raw\nCharacters which would normally have special meaning\nare treated as normal characters inside the #raw block.\n#end</pre>\n\n<p>Notice how the string, <tt>#raw</tt>, inside the raw block does <em>not</em> have the effect of opening a new, nested raw block. This is because the <tt>#</tt> character loses its special meaning inside the block. This effect holds true up until the next <tt>#end</tt> directive.</p>\n\n<p>But what if you want to include a literal <tt>#end</tt> inside the block without terminating it. You could try escaping it (<tt>\\#end</tt>) but then you&apos;d be breaking the idea that special characters should be treated as normal characters inside the raw block (that is, you&apos;d be granting <tt>\\</tt> a special function inside the block).</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001208more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>The solution is to allow here documents:</p>\n\n<pre>#raw &lt;&lt;END_OF_HERE_DOCUMENT\nThe raw block can now include anything at all,\nincluding a literal #end without prematurely\nescaping the block.\nEND_OF_HERE_DOCUMENT</pre>\n\n<p>You can substitute <tt>END_OF_HERE_DOCUMENT</tt> for anything you want; I just chose that for the purposes of demonstration. Because there are an infinite range of possible of delimiter tokens, there are literally no limits for what you can include in your <tt>#raw</tt> blocks, apart from the physical and addressing limits of the memory in your machine.</p>\n\n<p>Implementing here documents was an interesting mini-challenge within the context of a Parser Expression Grammar (PEG) parser generator like the one used by Walrus. PEGs are totally unambiguous and deterministic, which requires you to know the allowed syntax at the time that you define the grammar. But it&apos;s hard to specify the sytax for a here document so early because you don&apos;t know what the user is going to select as their delimiter and so you have to have some kind of dynamic self-referencing mechanism:</p>\n\n<blockquote>A here document shall be a delimiter consisting of a &quot;string of characters&quot;, followed by a bunch of other characters, terminated by the &quot;string of characters&quot; that you previously identified as the delimiter.</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can&apos;t address this problem with a simple regular expression like this:</p>\n\n<pre>/[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9]*/</pre>\n\n<p>Because that can match a different delimiter each time you run it:</p>\n\n<pre>#raw &lt;&lt;FOO\nOur regular expression matches FOO,\nwhich is nice.\nBut it also matches BAR,\nwhich isn&apos;t what we want.\nBAR</pre>\n\n<p>You therefore need some way of expressing the notion in your grammar that you want to remember a token which you don&apos;t know at the time you author the grammar, and later apply that to the input.</p>\n\n<p>Ruby comes to the rescue here with the fantastically useful <tt>lambda</tt> method. This essentially allows you to define an anonymous function (technically a <tt>Proc</tt> object) in the middle of your grammar which has access to all the variables in scope at the time of definition, and which can handle the logic for &quot;recording&quot; the start delimited and then scanning up to it.</p>\n\n<p>The design of the Walrus parser generator already includes a bunch of handy classes (&quot;parslets&quot;) to make writing this logic extremely easy. My implementation basically behaves just like the one in Ruby, and allows indentation of the closing delimiter via the <tt>&lt;&lt;-</tt> syntax.</p>\n\n<p>So now Walrus has a <tt>ProcParslet</tt> class in addition to the existing <tt>String</tt>, <tt>Regexp</tt> and <tt>Symbol</tt> equivalents. This may well be the last low-level parslet type I ever have to add because with it you can do pretty much anything; the sky is the limit.</p>\n</div></div>",

I&apos;m leaving the original text of the post below for the historical record.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ooooh, I hope the title of this post isn&apos;t too dramatic. I just got a GoDaddy renewal notice for the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/bansshee/\">Bansshee</a> domain names (bansshee.com, bansshee.net, bansshee.org) and I&apos;m looking for donations to fund their renewal.</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/01/wincent_vs_goda.php\">written before</a> about how I don&apos;t want to cave in to GoDaddy&apos;s &quot;bait and switch&quot; pricing scams (previous articles: <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2005/05/godaddy_vs_netw.php\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/05/godaddys_renewa.php\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/07/godaddy_scam.php\">3</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/08/darn_godaddy.php\">4</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/11/fighting_godadd.php\">5</a>). So at the start of this year I basically took the decision to let all non-essential domain names I have registered with GoDaddy expire. The Bansshee domain names are among the affected ones.</p>\n\n<h4>About Bansshee</h4>\n\n<p>Bansshee is a lightweight daemon written in Perl designed to thwart dictionary-based SSH brute force attacks. It is free software released under the GPL. Given that I don&apos;t actually make any money out of Bansshee (no donations so far, although I have received code-contributions from two kind souls) I&apos;m asking if anyone would like to step forward and make a donation to cover some part (or all) of the renewal costs for these domains. The domains aren&apos;t essential for the continuation of the project (the software will continue to be hosted <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/bansshee/\">here</a>) but I&apos;d like to continue providing them as a convenience for users if I can.</p>\n\n<p>If the donations cover the costs then I&apos;ll transfer the domains away from GoDaddy to another register, probably <a href=\"http://joker.com/\">Joker</a>. The highest priority will be bansshee.org, followed by dot-com and finally dot-net. Take a look at their <a href=\"https://joker.com/index.joker?mode=page&amp;page=pricing\">price list</a> if you&apos;d like to donate. You can send your donations via PayPal using <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=win@wincent.com&amp;item_name=Bansshee+DNS+donation&amp;no_note=1&amp;currency_code=EUR&amp;lc=en\">this link</a>.</p>\n\n<p>More information about Bansshee can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/bansshee/\">project page</a> and in the two articles (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/04/bansshee_my_ans.php\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/04/bansshee_update.php\">2</a>) that I wrote while developing it.</p>\n\n<p>Bansshee itself has been running on this server shielding it from the brunt of brute-force SSH dictionary attacks for almost a year now. It was deployed in April 2006 and then tested up until public release in October 2006 without skipping a beat. As an example of its reliability, it&apos;s been running without interruption for 141 days now (since the last server reboot for an operating system update). Not bad for a little daemon written in Perl!</p>\n\n<p>I don&apos;t really know if anyone will step forward on this one; regular readers of this weblog are familiar with my disappointment in the viability of open source software for extremely small businesses like my own. I&apos;d love someone to surprise me.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001311more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

Today he published an article about <a href=\"http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/archives/2007/03/mediawiki2html.html\">converting MediaWiki markup to HTML</a>.</p>\n<p>It turns out that that is something I&apos;ve wanted to do for some time now. Well, not so much the general markup itself (we already have <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Markdown\">Markdown</a> for that) but the wiki links where you can write words or phrases surrounded by double square brackets and they&apos;ll be turned into links to articles on the wiki.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Markham&apos;s article I learned about the <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/~dprice/Text-MediawikiFormat-0.05/lib/Text/MediawikiFormat.pm\">Text::MediawikiFormat module</a>, which is a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Perl\">Perl</a> module that can convert text written using <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/MediaWiki\">MediaWiki</a> markup to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/HTML\">HTML</a> using a simple <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/API\">API</a>:</p>\n<pre>my $converted = Text::MediawikiFormat::format($text);</pre>\n<p>I use <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/MovableType\">MovableType</a> to write these weblog entries and I have often wanted to be able to type a wiki-style link to &quot;something&quot; in an entry and have it link to the &quot;something&quot; page on the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Knowledge%20Base\">Knowledge Base</a>. About 20 minutes of learning the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/MovableType\">MovableType</a> API later I have a nice little plug-in that allows me to write entries like this one and link to the wiki with ease. It&apos;s literally one line of meaningful code; the rest is just plug-in registration and other bookkeeping. The only limitation I&apos;ve found so far is that it doesn&apos;t seem to support the &quot;nowiki&quot; and &quot;pre&quot; directives in the same way that <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/MediaWiki\">MediaWiki</a> does (see tickets <a href=\"http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=25417\">25417</a> and <a href=\"http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=25418\">25418</a>).</p>\n<p>See &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Writing%20a%20WikiText%20plug-in%20for%20MovableType\">Writing a WikiText plug-in for MovableType</a>&quot; for the not-very-gory details.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a001320more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

Almost every file has been touched, every project, every target... thousands of lines of changes and major structural reorganization. A lot of this has been mind-numbing work, a necessary evil to enable future growth, but with no short-term reward (no build-and-run gratification).\nBut it finally runs again after hundreds of hours of the most boring type of development work there is. Still some issues to iron out, but my plan now is to keep it in a very-near-to-release state from here on; that is, I will be approximating the &quot;continuous integration&quot; model of development, where the software will always be in a releasable or almost-releasable state. At any point in time I should be able to decide, ok, I want to package up a release for tomorrow, and be able to do it.</blockquote>\n\n\n<div id=\"a001323more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>This makes sense for business reasons (customers get their hands on releases more often) but it also makes sense for philosophical <em>and</em> technical reasons. Philosophical because openness is the right thing to do (by letting your customers see what you&apos;re doing you&apos;re treating them as you yourself would like to be treated). Technical because an open process produces better software (code is tested sooner, bugs reported more quickly, and having to produce builds which must always be acceptable for public viewing imposes a discipline on your coding).</p>\n<p>I&apos;ve been taking small steps towards a more open development model for many months now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making more of my projects open source: <a href=\"http://test.wincent.com\">WOTest</a>, <a href=\"http://bansshee.wincent.com/\">Bansshee</a>, <a href=\"http://winswitch.wincent.com\">WinSwitch</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/atosym/\">atosym</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/buildtools/\">Wincent Build Tools</a>, and <a href=\"http://strings.wincent.com/\">Wincent Strings Utility</a>.</li>\n<li>Moving the code for these open source projects into a publicly accessible <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion\">Subversion</a> repository.</li>\n<li>Publishing an <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/atom.xml\">RSS feed</a> of <em>all</em> commits so that customers can see source code changes even in closed-source products.</li>\n<li>Putting bug reports and feature requests out in the open in a <a href=\"http://bugs.wincent.com/\">publicly accessible database</a>.</li>\n<li>Having open-to-all <a href=\"http://lists.wincent.com\">beta-testing mailing lists</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But I can and want to go further. Why only approximate a continuous integration model when you could actually go the whole distance?</p>\n<p>After reading Joel Spolsky&apos;s article, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000023.html\">Daily Builds Are Your Friend</a>&quot;, I&apos;ve identified the missing link that up until now has prevented me from contemplating &quot;nightlies&quot; like those made available by many open source projects:</p>\n<blockquote>Here&apos;s how to do them. You need a daily build server, which will probably be the fastest computer you can get your hands on. Write a script which checks out a complete copy of the current source code from the repository (you are using source control, aren&apos;t you?) and then builds, from scratch, every version of the code that you ship. If you have an installer or setup program, build that too. Everything you ship to customers should be produced by the daily build process. Put each build in its own directory, coded by date. Run your script at a fixed time every day.</blockquote>\n<p>I already have a highly automated build process where I can build Synergy Advance by clicking the &quot;Build&quot; button in Xcode. It builds all the dependencies, assembles them together and even makes the disk image for distribution to users.</p>\n<p>But we can go further.</p>\n<p>If we can do a one-step build, why not extend things and automate that build so it runs at the same time every day <em>and</em> uploads the built product to the server? So I was partly inspired by Joel&apos;s article and partly by the Ruby gems I&apos;ve been looking at lately and whose Rakefiles (think Makefiles) include tasks to upload new releases.</p>\n<p>So that&apos;s my intention. I&apos;m going to extend my build process and automate it so that it checks out a clean copy of the latest version of the source code for each product, builds and uploads to the server.</p>\n<p>There are no guarantees that these cutting edge releases will even work, but I&apos;ll certainly make my best effort to ensure that they do as often as possible. I won&apos;t be promoting these nightlies for widespread use. But they&apos;ll be linked to from the downloads page and they&apos;ll be there for the curious.</p>\n<p>This will require some tweaks and special logic in the build process: I&apos;ll need to make my version numbers include the Subversion revision number to prevent consecutive nightly builds from looking alike; I&apos;ll need to handle the case where no changes have taken place in a particular product in the last 24 hours; I&apos;ll need to set up an RSS feed where people can see when new nightlies are pushed out...</p>\n<p>So my plan is to get this up and running as soon as possible. Watch this space for more info.</p>\n<a name=\"Update%3A%2015%20March%202007\"></a><h3>Update: 15 March 2007</h3>\n\n<p>The initial version of the system is now deployed and the first nightlies are available. See <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/s/nightlies/\">this article for more information</a>.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

The folks at <a href=\"http://mozilla.org/\">Mozilla</a> (makers of <a href=\"http://getfirefox.com/\">FireFox</a>) describe them as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Created most weekdays from the previous day&apos;s work, these builds may or may not work. Use them to verify that a bug you&apos;re tracking has been fixed.\nWe make nightly builds for testing only. We write code and post the results right away so people like you can join our testing process and report bugs. You will find bugs, and lots of them. Mozilla might crash on startup. It might delete all your files and cause your computer to burst into flames. Don&apos;t bother downloading nightly builds if you&apos;re unwilling to put up with problems.</blockquote>\n<p>Nightly builds are produced by many great open source projects such as <a href=\"http://nightly.webkit.org/\">WebKit</a> and <a href=\"http://nightlies.videolan.org/\">VLC</a> (as well as other <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/download/nightly/\">not-so-great ones</a>).

You can see which changes are being checked in in real-time by subscribing to the <a href=\"wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/atom.xml\">Git log</a>.</li>\n<li>If changes have been made checks out (clones) a complete copy of the latest version of the codebase.</li>\n<li>Performs a full build of the software; this may be a multi-step process.</li>\n<li>Runs any automated tests.</li>\n<li>Uploads the built software to the server. Each nightly will be identified by a unique combination of product name and Git hash: for example, the first Synergy nightly was labelled as &quot;Synergy (revision 325)&quot;; note that the revision number is <em>not</em> the same as the official version number used to label official releases.</li>\n<li>Publishes a new entry to the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/nightlog/\">Nightlog</a> (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/nightlog/atom.xml\">feed</a>) including basic information about the build (name, size, checksum, download URL and so forth).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although the builds are called &quot;nightlies&quot; there are a number of reasons why a new nightly might not appear on any given day:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If no changes have been finalized in the previous 24 hours then no new build will be made.<ul>\n<li>This will often be the case as I tend to work on the same product for a whole day at a time, sometimes several consecutive days, before switching over to work on another product.</li>\n<li>Another factor is that some changes only become visible when they are &quot;committed&quot; to the repository (finalized), so work may be in progress but I may not yet be ready to commit it. I try to follow a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/continuous%20integration\">continuous integration</a> development model which means that only changes which don&apos;t cause test failures get committed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If there are any build errors then the nightly isn&apos;t uploaded; this should rarely happen as I continuously test my changes as I apply them but it could conceivably occur occasionally.</li>\n<li>If any automated unit tests fail then the nightly isn&apos;t uploaded; again this should rarely happen as I continuously test my changes but it could occur when making larger changes to the codebase (although I try to break such large changes into smaller, incremental steps wherever possible).</li>\n<li>If there are local network connectivity problems here where I do my development work (in Spain); the builds take place here on my local system, but they depend on connectivity to the Subversion server (USA) and the webserver (USA).</li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"Links\"></a><h3>Links</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>List of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/nightlog/archives/synergy/\">Synergy nightlies</a>.</li>\n<li>List of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/nightlog/archives/synergy_advance/\">Synergy Advance nightlies</a></li>\n<li>List of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/nightlog/archives/hextrapolate/\">Hextrapolate nightlies</a></li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/nightlog/\">Nightlog archives</a> for all products.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/nightlog/atom.xml\">Nightlog RSS feed</a>.</li>\n<li>Summary of recent entries to the Nightlog (see the right-hand column of my <a href=\"http://colaiuta.net/\">personal weblog</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"Disclaimer\"></a><h3>Disclaimer</h3>\n\n<p>As noted on the Nightlog pages:</p>\n<blockquote>Nightly builds are generated once per day by an automated system; they are not official releases and they receive no human testing prior to being uploaded.

You may also wish to make sure that your spam filters don&apos;t mistakenly eat any such messages, and if you have a challenge-response anti-spam system you&apos;ll need to turn that off or manually override it (the license issuing system ignores such challenges).

Well, not exactly hammering but generating a steady 5 to 10 kilobytes of traffic per second. It was as though my machine was being used as a gateway.</p>\n<p>So I tried to rule things out one by one. Internet connection sharing was turned off. I wasn&apos;t running Tor or Privoxy. I ended up quitting basically everything and the traffic continued. I then tried to block the offending IP address using <tt>ipfw</tt> and the traffic still continued.</p>\n<pre>sudo ipfw add deny ip from 192.168.1.34 to any\nsudo ipfw add deny ip from any to 192.168.1.34</pre>\n<p>I have no idea why this didn&apos;t work but I continued to see <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/TCP\">TCP</a> traffic. Variations on these rules didn&apos;t seem to work either. I then committed the mistake that required the reboot:</p>\n<pre>sudo ipfw add deny all from any to any</pre>\n<p>That stopped the traffic all right but it stopped everything else, including <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/NetInfo\">NetInfo</a> lookups, and that meant that the following didn&apos;t work:</p>\n<pre>sudo ipfw delete 100</pre>\n<p>Nothing <tt>sudo</tt> worked because it couldn&apos;t look up my credentials and complained that user ID 501 didn&apos;t exist in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>. So I tried to reboot and Mac OS X decided to hang forever at the blue screen, requiring a hard reset.

    "html": "<p>As of today the build numbering system used in <a href=\"http://advance.wincent.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> has undergone a once-off change and I wanted to explain here to help clear up any confusion that it may cause.</p>\n<p>The changes are described in full in the &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Build%20numbers\">Build numbers</a>&quot; article but here&apos;s the brief overview:</p>\n<p>Previously Synergy Advance used a build number scheme that incremented by 1.0 for each release build and 0.1 for each debug build. So the last publicly released version (0.4) had a build number of 1192.0.</p>\n<p>As of today, I&apos;ve started using the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion\">Subversion</a> revision number instead because this is non-arbitrary and exactly identifies the source code used to produce the built product. That means that as of right now the current build number is actually 399, corresponding to revision 399 in the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion\">Subversion</a> repository. By the time 0.5 comes out (hopefully quite soon) that revision number will have jumped up a few notches. Build numbers like &quot;399+&quot; indicate that the build was produced from the code corresponding to revision 399 in the repository plus some local modifications that haven&apos;t been checked in yet. In reality only I will see build numbers like that with plus signs on the end; customers will always see straight build numbers.</p>\n<p>I&apos;m making these changes to provide increased transparency in the development process. You can keep your eye on the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/index.php\">Subversion Log</a> (a live list of checkins) and see exactly which code changes correspond to the build that you&apos;re using.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a001422more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Spammers.</p>\n<p>The scourge of the Internet. We have so much to thank them for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The waves of junk mail pouring into our inboxes.</li>\n<li>The painful challenge-response systems that stop us from sending legitimate email.</li>\n<li>The DNS blacklists that make sending mail from a dynamic IP unfeasible.</li>\n<li>The throw-away email addresses that we register to protect our real address.</li>\n<li>The forced migrations from one spam-inundated account to an inevitably to-be-inundanted other.</li>\n<li>The greylists that slow down our legitimate outgoing messages.</li>\n<li>The moderation that dampens discussion lists.</li>\n<li>The virtual ruination of NNTP, in my view largely spared only by <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Google\">Google</a> and their <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/\">groups gateway</a>.</li>\n<li>The endless confirmation emails that we must work through in order to register at new sites.</li>\n<li>Email addresses that you can&apos;t click on, but that you have to &quot;translate&quot; from based on what you see in an image or some kind of code.</li>\n<li>Companies that you can&apos;t email even though you&apos;re a paying customer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I could go on but by now you&apos;re getting the idea. And that&apos;s only in the realm of email; spammers have also done and are doing their very best to ruin forums, weblogs and every other online space.</p>\n<p>Well, I&apos;m sick of running. I&apos;m sick of hiding. I don&apos;t want my customers to have to jump through hoops in order to contact me. I used to think that controlling spam required proper server-level measures (blacklisting, filtering, proper <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/sendmail\">sendmail</a> configuration) combined with client-level filtering <em>and</em> a big dose of obscurity (email hiding) thrown in.</p>\n<p>For a long time I tried to keep my email address off the site, and in the places where I did show it I used cryptic equivalents like &quot;win at this domain&quot;. I tried to channel all contact through a web contact form. I even migrated from my old address <a href=\"mailto:win@wincent.org\">win@wincent.org</a> to <a href=\"mailto:win@wincent.com\">win@wincent.com</a> because the old address was receiving too much spam.</p>\n<p>Well, I&apos;m a bit tired of all that. I think it sends the wrong message to customers. It <em>really</em> means, &quot;Spammers, I don&apos;t want to hear from you&quot;, but it can actually make customers feel like I&apos;m saying, &quot;Customers, I don&apos;t want to hear from you&quot;. This isn&apos;t true. I <em>do</em> want to hear from customers. Customer feedback helps to improve products and keeps one motivated. Even the &quot;bad&quot; types of customer contact (complaints, &quot;silly&quot; questions) are in indication of things that you should be doing better (ways your documentation could be improved, ways your interfaces could be changed so that those kinds of questions don&apos;t crop up).</p>\n<p>I still believe that server-side measures and client-side filtering are very important (see the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Knowledge%20Base\">Knowledge Base</a> article &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Combating%20spam\">Combating spam</a>&quot;) but I&apos;ve decided to throw the obscurity part out the window. If you&apos;ve been reading this weblog of late you&apos;ll be aware of the moves towards openness and transparency that I&apos;ve been making; this new attitude towards email and spam is just another step.</p>\n<p>As part of this I have plans to revamp this site and make it more open and integrated. Yes, my initial dislike for all things <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Web%202.0\">Web 2.0</a> has settled down and I&apos;m planning on taking from it the best bits and leaving out the bits I don&apos;t like. Once the revamp is done you&apos;ll still find a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/contact/mail/\">contact form</a> for those who can&apos;t send email, but you&apos;ll find my email address writ up front and large for those who want to get in touch quickly and easily via email.</p>\n<p>Please contact me (<a href=\"mailto:win@wincent.com\">win@wincent.com</a>) if you have any comments or suggestions.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a001459more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "file": "content/blog/be-assertive",
    "html": "<p>Most imperative programming consists of lists of instructions, where subsequent instructions tend to depend on the results of previous instructions:</p>\n\n<pre>01 get A\n02 pass A to B, producing C\n03 get D\n04 add C and D to get E\n05 ask E for F\n06 ask F for G\n07 print G</pre>\n\n<p>What do you do if you run the pseudo-code above but it doesn&apos;t print <tt>G</tt> like you expected?</p>\n\n<p>The obvious answer is that you back-track: you find out why <tt>F</tt> didn&apos;t return <tt>G</tt>. Part of that will involve confirming that you actually did get <tt>F</tt> from <tt>E</tt> like you asked. If you&apos;re unlucky, your troubleshooting process may require several iterations and you&apos;ll end up going all the way back to the first line and discover that the problem is occurring when you try to get <tt>A</tt>.</p>\n\n<h3>Fail early</h3>\n\n<p>Instead of working backwards a much better approach is to start at the beginning. You want to fail early; or to put it another way, in the event of a failure you want to find out about it as early as possible. You want failure notifications to be produced as close to the site of the actual failure as possible, so that you can find the causes more quickly.</p>\n\n<p>The way you do this is with assertions.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a001483more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<h3>Assertions</h3>\n\n<pre>01 get A\n02 assert: should have A\n03 pass A to B, producing C\n04 assert: B should have returned C\n05 get D\n06 assert: should have D\n07 add C and D to get E\n08 assert: adding C to D should have yielded E\n09 ask E for F\n10 assert: E should have returned F\n11 ask F for G\n12 assert: F should have returned G\n13 print G</pre>\n\n<p>Now our code is a little bit longer (bad) but if there is a failure at any point we&apos;ll instantly know exactly which line failed (good). In reality you probably don&apos;t need to declare assertions after every single operation so the minor penalty (the added length) is generally far outweighed by the benefit (development and debugging speed). In actual practice you would tend to add assertions only at key points where you are aware that something might fail or you are making an assumption about the state of the program at that point in time:</p>\n\n<blockquote>Don&apos;t make assumptions. Make assertions.</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are many times were your assumptions will prove to be wrong. Any time you find yourself thinking, &quot;Ok, this should be like this at this point, so I can now go ahead and...&quot;, that should be a flag to you that you should be inserting an assertion into your code.</p>\n\n<p>Liberal use of assertions is like unit testing. To the beginner it may seem like extra work, but to the programmer who has tried coding without assertions and then tries coding with them discovers that they help you to produce better, more robust code, discover and fix bugs more quickly, and they give you a confidence that frees you to write code much faster. Don&apos;t waste brain cycles wondering about all the possible ways in which code might fail: just identify what conditions you expect to be true and write assertions accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>In Objective-C the tools you use for assertions are <tt>NSAssert</tt>, <tt>NSCAssert</tt> and <tt>NSParameterAssert</tt>, or you can roll you own.</p>\n\n<p>If you are worried about all those assertions slowing down your code you can use them in debug builds and beta releases only and turn them off for official releases by defining the <tt>NS_BLOCK_ASSERTIONS</tt> macro. When that macro is defined the assertion macros compile down to nothing at all. Obviously, when you do this you lose the protection and early warnings afforded by assertions, so this is yet another reason to be very thorough in your testing and beta testing.</p>\n\n<p>With time you&apos;ll get a feel for whether constructions like:</p>\n\n<pre>result = [[[object message1] message2] messge3];\nNSAssert(result != nil, @&quot;result must not be nil&quot;);</pre>\n\n<p>Or like:</p>\n\n<pre>first = [object message1];\nNSAssert(first != nil, @&quot;first must not be nil&quot;);\nsecond = [first message2];\nNSAssert(second != nil, @&quot;second must not be nil&quot;);\nresult = [second messge3];\nNSAssert(result != nil, @&quot;result must not be nil&quot;);</pre>\n\n<p>Are best for a given circumstance. You might also want to write assertion macros of your own so that you can use a more compact syntax; for example, I&apos;ve never liked having to provide description strings so I&apos;ve got macros which don&apos;t require them:</p>\n\n<pre>result = [[[object message1] message2] messge3];\nWOAssert(result != nil);</pre>\n\n<p>The assertion machinery printed enough information (source code file name and line number) for me to know where the failure occurred so writing that description string is unnecessary overhead.</p>\n\n<p>Before closing there are a couple of nuances that should be mentioned:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Assertions are not a replacement for exception handling, normal error-code handling, or unit testing; they are an additional tool that complements the other methods.</li>\n<li>If a method or function is documented to have different possible return values you should be prepared to handle them; that is, if an error can occur somewhere outside of your control (in a system API, for example) then you should write code to handle that eventuality. This is because you don&apos;t want your program to crash because of something that happened outside of your domain of control. Handle errors gracefully.</li>\n<li>Likewise if a method or function outside of your control (again, a system API) might throw an exception, you should be prepared to catch it and respond accordingly. This is again because you don&apos;t want your program crashing in response to an error that occurred outside your circle of influence.</li>\n<li>As such, assertions are best used for confirming the validity of assumptions about your own code. A failed assertion is caused by something that you wrote not behaving like you require; in other words, a bug. You should be adding assertions to places where failed expectations mean that your code is incorrect and you need to fix it.</li>\n<li> An assertion is a catastrophic failure. It leads to an <tt>NSInternalInconsistencyException</tt> being thrown. If this isn&apos;t handled at a higher level it can cause your program to fail. As such, the other acceptable use of assertions is in cases where you &apos;&apos;want&apos;&apos; things to fail catastrophically in the event of a failed assumption; that is, in cases where a failure means you literally can&apos;t proceed and you want to give up. When you see this kind of assertion failing you have two choices: write additional code so that the catastrophic failure becomes a gracefully-handled error; or leave it the way it is as a catastrophic, irrecoverable error.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>After a cracker broke into the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WordPress\">WordPress</a> server last month and replaced the official download with a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/trojan\">trojan</a> (an incident <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/development/2007/04/wordpress-213-and-2010/\">described</a> by the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WordPress\">WordPress</a> <a href=\"http://photomatt.net/\">public-relations team</a> as a &quot;systems issue&quot;) I decided to give <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WordPress\">WordPress</a> the flick, forever (see &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Removing%20a%20WordPress%202.1.1%20installation%20and%20replacing%20it%20with%20a%20static%20mirror\">Removing a WordPress 2.1.1 installation and replacing it with a static mirror</a>&quot;).</p>\n<p>Today brings <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/development/2007/04/wordpress-213-and-2010/\">another update</a>, once again security-driven.</p>\n<blockquote>This update is highly recommend for all users of both branches.</blockquote>\n<p><em>Translation:</em> upgrade immediately or get owned.</p>\n<blockquote>These releases include fixes for several publicly known minor XSS issues, one major XML-RPC issue, and a proactive full sweep of the WordPress codebase to protect against future problems.</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WordPress\">WordPress</a> team needs to change the way they work with respect to security. This is a very popular, public-facing web application. Instead of springing these forced security updates (&quot;upgrade now or else&quot;) on the masses they should do three or four things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Adopt a regular, public update schedule for security updates so that people can plan and be ready for security updates. Something simple like &quot;first Tuesday of every month&quot;.</li>\n<li>Have a core-team-only security branch which is merged into the publicly-viewable branches only just before release. More on this point below.</li>\n<li>Implement a mandatory review process in which every single check-in must pass a security review by another team member; this security-specific review should be in addition to any existing review procedures they might have (emphasis on the <em>might</em>).</li>\n<li>Appoint a security officer whose responsibilities include a coordinating regular, pro-active audits of the code base.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now to address the second point above; I love the open source development model and I think it&apos;s great to develop stuff out in the open. But when it comes to security fixes for vulnerabilities need to be kept secret until they are released. With <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WordPress\">WordPress</a> we currently have the worst of both worlds: throughout the entire development cycle attackers can monitor the <a href=\"http://trac.wordpress.org/\">WordPress trac</a> for vulnerability reports and the corresponding fixes and start working on exploits; meanwhile, users are exposed to risk and then on release day told to upgrade as quickly as possible or face the consequences.</p>\n<p>They need to get their security fixes on a private branch. This is not a desktop application like <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Firefox\">Firefox</a>. If you&apos;re on holiday and upgrade your browser a week late then it&apos;s no big deal; but if you&apos;re a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WordPress\">WordPress</a> administrator and an exploit gets released while you&apos;re on a beach in Santo Domingo then your risk is many times greater. The dealing of security issues in the open followed by sudden, irregular releases without proper advance notice for scheduling just makes this problem worse.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WordPress\">WordPress</a> security track record has been appalling in the past so we can safely assume that vulnerabilities will continue to be discovered.</p>\n<blockquote>We have taken dozens of additional precautions with the servers and systems that run WordPress.org and they appear to be working well, despite hundreds of hack attempts after we publicly disclosed there had been a problem. We are also now aggressively monitoring all downloads for any changes or modifications, and we are confident the same type of problem won&#x2019;t happen again.</blockquote>\n<p>My response: too little, too late.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a001532more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

This is because I want to move towards a more <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/03/planned_changes.php\">open development process</a>.</p>\n<p>Today <a href=\"http://advance.wincent.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> has been added to the nightly builds schedule.</p>\n<p>These builds are for the curious who wish to get a sneak peak at work in progress towards the next version. The current official release (0.4) is still the one that is recommended for daily use and is available from the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/download/\">downloads page</a>. </p>\n<p>The usual disclaimers apply to the nightly builds:</p>\n<blockquote>Nightly builds are generated once per day by an automated system; they are not official releases and they receive no human testing prior to being uploaded. They are provided with no warranty of any kind; use them at your own risk.</blockquote>\n<p>I would describe the current Synergy Advance nightly (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion\">Subversion</a> revision 429) as being alpha-quality. There are many rough edges, known issues, and things that plain just don&apos;t work yet. If you keep your eye on the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/nightlog/atom.xml\">Nightlog RSS feed</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2007/03/wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/atom.xml\">Subversion commits feed</a> you&apos;ll see that things very rapidly move towards beta-level and then final release before the end of this month (April 2007).</p>\n<p>If you have any questions you&apos;re welcome to contact me at <a href=\"mailto:win@wincent.com\">win@wincent.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a001563more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

I already held a license for the standard version of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Snapz%20Pro%20X\">Snapz Pro X</a>, and normally I would lean towards it because it is the product with the more established reputation <em>but</em> after trialling <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/iShowU\">iShowU</a> for just 5 minutes I decided it was the one for me. It costs US$20 (compared with US$40 for the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Snapz%20Pro%20X\">Snapz Pro X</a> upgrade) and has a large number of features and preferences that make it ideal for screencasting; I&apos;m sure that you&apos;ll feel the same if you give it a try.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/KeyCastr\">KeyCastr</a> is used to show what keys are being pressed on the keyboard. It too is highly customizable and once again there&apos;s no competition. It&apos;s freeware.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/OmniDazzle\">OmniDazzle</a> is used to highlight the location of the pointer.</p>\n<p>These tools are ideal for throwing together a quick-and-dirty screencast like yesterday&apos;s; that is one where you want to just to do one take and record live audio as you go. For lengthier, more polished screencasts I think you&apos;ll have to do multiple takes, record the audio separately (almost definitely with a microphone other than the built-in one that came with your Mac), and put it all together in Final Cut Pro as <a href=\"http://rentzsch.com/notes/screencastingWithSnapzProAndFinalCutPro\">described here</a>.</p>\n<p>I found out about most of these tools from watching the screencasts provided by <a href=\"http://www.railscasts.com\">Railscasts</a>. They have very high production values and are well worth checking out if you want to learn about <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby%20on%20Rails\">Ruby on Rails</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a001732more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Along with my other development work, since the start of the year I&apos;ve been working on an object-oriented templating system called <a href=\"http://walrus.wincent.com\">Walrus</a>. Its functionality is similar to that of the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Cheetah\">Cheetah</a> templating engine but it&apos;s written in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby\">Ruby</a> instead of in Python. It&apos;s a wheel that I was forced to reinvent for two reasons: one, the fact that I don&apos;t know Python; and two, problems with Cheetah (missing features or undesired behaviours) which I couldn&apos;t correct because I don&apos;t know Python... At this stage it offers only a subset of the Cheetah functionality but it&apos;s powerful enough to do what I designed it for: making documentation for display in Apple&apos;s Help Viewer.</p>\n<p>It turns out that what started out as a simple project ended up becoming quite a bit more complex. But I&apos;m very glad I did it because I learned a great deal along the way and my familiarity with Ruby has gone through the roof: something that will be very useful as I work on the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Rails\">Rails</a> rewrite of this site and start using the Ruby scripting bridge that <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Apple\">Apple</a> will ship with <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard\">Leopard</a>.</p>\n<p>Walrus is essentially a compiler that reads files written in a special templating markup (almost identical to that used by Cheetah) and compiles them down to Ruby code. The final output is produced by &quot;filling&quot; (running) the compiled templates. There is a <tt>walrus</tt> <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/command%20line\">command line</a> tool that serves as a front end and makes it easy to process templates in batch style. At its core Walrus employs a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/packrat\">packrat</a> parser which can recognize any <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/PEG\">PEG</a> and even accepts constructs that wouldn&apos;t usually be legal in a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/PEG\">PEG</a> such as left-recursive productions. The parser is capable of producing arbitrarily complex <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/ASTs\">ASTs</a>. Although I&apos;m using it to produce help documentation the design is general enough to be used in any situation where you want to transform text from one format to another. All this means that it is a tool that could end up proving quite useful.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a001736more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<a name=\"The%20output\"></a><h2>The output</h2>\n\n<p>It&apos;s been very gratifying over the last few days to see it finally come to the point where I can start leveraging it for use in my own applications. <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/hextrapolate_help_screenshot.png\">Click here for a screenshot</a> of the help pages for <a href=\"http://hextrapolate.wincent.com\">Hextrapolate</a>.</p>\n<p>I want the documentation to look beautiful to the user, so the style sheets are based on the current Apple look and feel in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Tiger\">Tiger</a>.

you set it up once when you first create the page and then leave it alone. Most of your ongoing editing takes place below the row of hash markers. This is your sandbox:</p>\n<pre>#def content\n\nTo reset Hextrapolate&apos;s preferences perform the following steps.\n\n&lt;div id=&quot;task_box&quot;&gt;\n\n` Quit Hextrapolate\n` Using the Finder, go to your home directory and open the &lt;tt&gt;Library folder\n` Inside the &lt;tt&gt;Library folder, open the &lt;tt&gt;Preferences folder\n` Drag the file &lt;tt&gt;com.wincent.Hextrapolate.plist from the &lt;tt&gt;Preferences folder to your Desktop, or to the Trash if you wish to dispose of it permanently\n\nThe next time you launch Hextrapolate it will automatically create a new preferences file.\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n#end</pre>\n<p>In other words, most of the time you only have to focus on the true <em>content</em> of each document. You don&apos;t have to think about the headers, the footers, the styles or anything else. What happens if Apple changes the way its help documentation looks in Leopard? It&apos;s easy enough to change the CSS but what if they make deep structural changes as well? With object-oriented templating this is dead easy: just change the parent classes higher up in the inheritance hierarchy and all the children will automatically be updated.</p>\n<a name=\"The%20%26quot%3BPHP%26quot%3B%20model\"></a><h3>The &quot;PHP&quot; model</h3>\n\n<p>So how is this different from the traditional <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/PHP\">PHP</a>-style model of template re-use? In that model you define a master container and then you split off common elements into separate documents (header, footer etc). Each page basically looks like this:</p>\n<pre>include(&apos;header&apos;)\n&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;\ninclude(&apos;footer&apos;)</pre>\n<p>Now whenever you need to change your header you change it in only one place and all the pages on your site pick up the change.</p>\n<p>So one day you realize that you want a side bar in your site and you have to edit every single page so that it looks like this:</p>\n<pre>include(&apos;header&apos;)\ninclude(&apos;sidebar&apos;)\n&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;\ninclude(&apos;footer&apos;)</pre>\n<p>You don&apos;t want to be burnt by that little mistake again, so you decide to split your content out into separate files too. Now you have centralized the header, the side bar, the footer into a single location so that they can be reused. And you&apos;ve gone a step further and modified all your content pages so that they include only the content and none of the surrounding material. Each content page now basically has this structure:</p>\n<pre>include(&apos;pre_content&apos;);\n&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;\ninclude(&apos;post_content&apos;);</pre>\n<p>Note that in order for this to work you have to maintain a <tt>pre_content</tt> file  which itself includes the header and the sidebar, and a <tt>post_content</tt> file which itself includes the footer.</p>\n<p>Sounds nice, but one day you decide that you want to show a sidebar on the other side too, but only on half the pages in the site. You can&apos;t just edit your <tt>post_content</tt> file because that would affect all pages, not just the half that you want to target. So your only option is to create a <tt>post_content2</tt> and manually edit half of your pages to include that... It&apos;s easy to see that this is a never ending race to maximize reuse and eliminate repetitive editing, but it&apos;s a race that you cannot win: you&apos;ll always be one step behind.</p>\n<a name=\"Object-orientation%20to%20the%20rescue\"></a><h3>Object-orientation to the rescue</h3>\n\n<p>If you are a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby\">Ruby</a> or <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Objective-C\">Objective-C</a> programmer then you already know the solution to this problem: you need an inheritance hierarchy. Common elements move &quot;up&quot; in the hierarchy (towards the root) where they can be easily inherited. Specialized elements move &quot;down&quot; in the hierarchy as overrides. In this way you keep things <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/DRY\">DRY</a>; you don&apos;t repeat yourself but instead ensure that information/behaviour is embodied at one and only one place in the hierarchy.</p>\n<p>This idea is equally applicable to documents, not just to programming. The conundrum faced by the PHP developer in the previous section would be addressed using object-oriented templating using a class hierarchy like the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Master template: defines the overall layout of pages on the site, including the default header, footer and sidebar<ul>\n<li>Special category template: overrides the master to add a second sidebar</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then each page on the site inherits from either the master or the special category template, overriding only the content block. Any changes made to the master affect all other pages on the site; changes made to the special category template affect only pages which inherit from it. Sweeping changes can be made by refactoring at any time: inserting a new template above or below the master, creating templates for other categories, adding subcategories. All of these changes are made in only one place and the effects automatically trickle down to where we want them.</p>\n<p>Walrus implements this inheritance model and as an added bonus provides an <tt>#include</tt> directive for those times where you want to incorporate something by reference instead of merely inheriting it. This is demonstrated in the previous example where it is used to pull in global settings from another file.</p>\n<p>And because all of this is written in Ruby and compiled down to Ruby code you can easily insert &quot;helper&quot; methods that help you eliminate error-prone or repetitive tasks like inserting links to other pages using Apple&apos;s non-standard Help linking system.</p>\n<a name=\"Conclusion\"></a><h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>The sky really is the limit on this one. One of the things that has always frustrated me about Apple&apos;s Help system is that it is very difficult to take the same documentation and use it both in the application itself as well as mirroring a copy to your website. If you use Apple&apos;s proprietary link style then your pages won&apos;t work on the web; if you use normal HTML links then you lose the frills that you get in Apple&apos;s Help Viewer. Furthermore, the system is poorly documented: most of the information is out-of-date or just plain missing (some of the <a href=\"http://andymatuschak.org/articles/2005/12/18/help-with-apple-help\">best information</a> is not actually provided by Apple). What happens if Apple changes the way it works in the future? For theses reasons I&apos;ve always been reluctant to include in-application Help.</p>\n<p>But using Walrus I am able to easily have the best of both worlds. I can have a helper function that emits Apple-style links if a particular environment variable is set at the time the templates are filled, and emits standard HTML links in other cases. If Apple ever changes the link format I&apos;ll just have to tweak the helper method and recompile.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

While Leopard&apos;s features will be complete by then, we cannot deliver the quality release that we and our customers expect from us. We now plan to show our developers a near final version of Leopard at the conference, give them a beta copy to take home so they can do their final testing, and ship Leopard in October. We think it will be well worth the wait. Life often presents tradeoffs, and in this case we&apos;re sure we&apos;ve made the right ones.</blockquote>\n<p>I&apos;m surprised. I fully expected that <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard\">Leopard</a> would ship in June. My suspicions were increased when I started following postings by an <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Apple\">Apple</a> employee on the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby%20Cocoa\">Ruby Cocoa</a> mailing list pushing for a 1.0 release by mid-April, evidently because Apple wants 1.0 in Leopard.</p>\n<p>Am I disappointed? A little. Upset? Not at all. I&apos;m happy that this will give me more time to work on Leopard-specific features for my products. Sure, I&apos;d like to start using <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Xcode\">Xcode</a> 3.0 full-time right now, and writing more garbage-collected <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Objective-C\">Objective-C</a> code; but if they need the time to get things polished and stable, better that than shipping something half-baked.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a001752more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

In that article I said:</p>\n<blockquote>The sky really is the limit on this one. One of the things that has always frustrated me about Apple&apos;s Help system is that it is very difficult to take the same documentation and use it both in the application itself as well as mirroring a copy to your website. If you use Apple&apos;s proprietary link style then your pages won&apos;t work on the web; if you use normal HTML links then you lose the frills that you get in Apple&apos;s Help Viewer. Furthermore, the system is poorly documented: most of the information is out-of-date or just plain missing (some of the <a href=\"http://andymatuschak.org/articles/2005/12/18/help-with-apple-help\">best information</a> is not actually provided by Apple). What happens if Apple changes the way it works in the future? For theses reasons I&apos;ve always been reluctant to include in-application Help.<br>\nBut using <a href=\"http://walrus.wincent.com/\">Walrus</a> I am able to easily have the best of both worlds. I can have a helper function that emits Apple-style links if a particular environment variable is set at the time the templates are filled, and emits standard HTML links in other cases. If Apple ever changes the link format I&apos;ll just have to tweak the helper method and recompile.</blockquote>\n<p>I&apos;ve just pushed out updates (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2007/04/hextrapolate_20_1.php\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2007/04/synergy_312_now.php\">2</a>) to <a href=\"http://hextrapolate.wincent.com/\">Hextrapolate</a> and <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">Synergy</a> which show the difference between my new approach and my old one.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a001782more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<a name=\"The%20old\"></a><h3>The old</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">Synergy</a> uses <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/\">online help documentation</a>. It&apos;s fairly extensive, but obviously can&apos;t be read offline unless you previously mirror it.</p>\n<p>When Synergy first came out I actually used embedded help documentation that could be viewed using Apple&apos;s Help Viewer. Back in version 1.2 (August 2004) I decided to stop doing that and instead keep all the help online. I was motivated by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bandwidth concerns (the documentation added about 25% to the application size).</li>\n<li>Spending too much time keeping the website and the application documentation in sync.</li>\n<li>Chasing two moving targets, and targets that were moving in different directions, by trying to keep both the in-application help and the website close to the then-current Apple aesthetic.</li>\n<li>Frustration at Apple&apos;s use of proprietary extensions for in-application help, and at the lack of documentation for the same.</li>\n<li>Frustration at the rendering capabilities of Apple&apos;s pre-WebKit Help Viewer; back in those days you couldn&apos;t even use CSS in your help books.</li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"The%20new\"></a><h3>The new</h3>\n\n<p>Things have changed a lot since 2004.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bandwidth is cheap, and people have faster connections.</li>\n<li>Apple&apos;s Help Viewer is now WebKit-based and can correctly render anything that Safari can render, which is pretty much anything if you adhere to the standards.</li>\n<li>CSS support means that you don&apos;t have to worry about chasing moving targets: you can separate your content from your presentation and update the latter on demand without having to trawl through your content and modify it.</li>\n<li>Using helper methods in <a href=\"http://walrus.wincent.com/\">Walrus</a> allows me to single-source my documentation and write my links the same way for the two targets (in-application help and web-based help); it also adds a layer of abstraction that insulates me from any changes that Apple might make to their proprietary and/or undocumented APIs in the future.</li>\n<li>Writing the documentation is a whole lot more pleasant because I can write it in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Textile\">Textile</a> and let Walrus handle the rest.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So <a href=\"http://hextrapolate.wincent.com/\">Hextrapolate</a> provides the best of both worlds for both user and developer. Users win because they get easy-to-use, task-based documentation in a familiar format (styled after the Apple application help that they&apos;re used to and delivered via the Help Viewer application that they all know).</p>\n<p>They can view the documentation at any time, even when they&apos;re offline, because it&apos;s embedded inside the application. But prospective users who don&apos;t have the application installed can look at it <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/hextrapolate/help/front_page.html\">online too</a>. The embedded help is easily searchable using the Help Viewer, and the online help is easily searched using the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/site-map/search/\">all-powerful Google</a>.</p>\n<p>I win as a developer too for the reasons already stated; above all because I can write the source documentation once and compile it for multiple targets. And it&apos;s not just rapid in the do-it-all-in-a-single-step sense; it&apos;s agile in the development sense too. Because Walrus is written in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby\">Ruby</a> I was able to add the dual-targetting capability in less than five-minutes, literally.</p>\n<a name=\"The%20future\"></a><h3>The future</h3>\n\n<p>If you&apos;ve been following the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/\">Subversion log</a> this past week you&apos;ll see that I&apos;ve been laying low on the check-in front. I&apos;ve been looking at speeding up Walrus by converting the parser (generated Ruby code) to a ultra-fast C extension. I first looked at using <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ragel\">Ragel</a> but am now leaning towards <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/ANTLR\">ANTLR</a> due to the complexity of the parser.</p>\n<p>The current parser works, but it&apos;s slower than I&apos;d like. I basically consider it a proof-of-concept prototype that demonstrates that the underlying grammar and workflow is a good, working idea, and that it&apos;s worthwhile going down to the metal and making a native, compiled parser for it. The compiler itself will continue to be Ruby.</p>\n<p>The Hextrapolate 2.0 documentation is not perfect &#x2014; I&apos;m aware of a minor flaw in it (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2007/04/wocommon_r362_1_item_changed.php\">already fixed</a>) and I was remiss in not exhaustively proof-reading it &#x2014; but I think it&apos;s a great first run for this new workflow. From here on all my products will start migrating to the new system, bit by bit.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Yesterday and today I&apos;ve been working on improving the automated testing process used when building products like <a href=\"http://advance.wincent.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> and <a href=\"http://hextrapolate.wincent.com/\">Hextrapolate</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a001816more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<a name=\"Goodbye%20failing%20tests\"></a><h3>Goodbye failing tests</h3>\n\n<p>I had some failing tests in place (<tt>WO_TEST_FAIL</tt>) to serve as reminders to go ahead and implement real tests at a later date. This is mostly in cases where the tests are fiendishly difficult to write (testing <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/GUI\">GUI</a> elements, for example) and I wasn&apos;t sure how to proceed.</p>\n<p>So I&apos;ve gotten rid of these placeholder tests and put good old-fashioned <tt>TODO</tt> comments in their place. This means that I can now do builds and expect 100% success rates; failure no longer means &quot;look into this later&quot;, it now means &quot;here&apos;s a problem that needs to be fixed right now&quot;. This is a change that I probably should have made a long time ago.</p>\n<p>This in turn makes my automated <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/s/nightlies/\">nightly builds process</a> more robust. Instead of manually reviewing the builds before allowing the nightly to proceed I am one step closer to letting them run truly automatically (for the time being I am still firing them off manually until I am 100% convinced that the process is bullet-proof).</p>\n<a name=\"Notifications\"></a><h3>Notifications</h3>\n\n<p>The next thing I want to do is show Growl notifications when test runs finish, using the <tt>growlnotify</tt> <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/CLI\">CLI</a> tool. In the case of nightlies I&apos;ll make these &quot;sticky&quot; notifications so that they&apos;ll hang around on the screen even if I&apos;m not in front of the computer at the time the nightlies run. In the case of normal builds I&apos;ll make them non-sticky.</p>\n<a name=\"Truly%20continuous%20integration\"></a><h3>Truly continuous integration</h3>\n\n<p>My next step will then be to set up truly continuous automated testing for better <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/continuous%20integration\">continuous integration</a>. The idea is to perform the following in the background in an endless loop:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Checkout an up-to-the-second copy of the project source code.</li>\n<li>Perform a full build at a lower priority (using <tt>nice</tt>).</li>\n<li>If any errors occur or unit tests fail, notify using <tt>growlnotify</tt>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The idea is that instead of thinking about doing a change-build-test cycle you just think about changes: change, change, change, change, continuously advancing and letting the background tests notify you if one of your changes needs revision.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK\">SVK</a> (which provides a local mirror of the remote <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion\">Subversion</a> repository) this cycle can be performed without hitting the network. Thanks to <tt>nice</tt> all this should be possible without bogging down the machine (although more memory would be nice, I admit).</p>\n<p>It shouldn&apos;t be too much work to set this up; I can probably just modify the current nightlies script and pass in a command-line switch to get the desired behaviour.</p>\n<p>This is just one of the ways in which my recent work using <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby\">Ruby</a> to write <a href=\"http://walrus.wincent.com/\">Walrus</a> has made me a better programmer; working with the excellent <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Autotest\">Autotest</a> suite prompted me to take this step.</p>\n<a name=\"Packaging%20tests\"></a><h3>Packaging tests</h3>\n\n<p>Finally, I want to add some more tests that focus on the built product (testing the build process) rather than on the code (testing the code). I&apos;ve found issues in the past where a piece of the program didn&apos;t work properly because of an issue external to the code; for example, an <tt>Info.plist</tt> file that was incorrectly encoded as <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/UTF-16\">UTF-16</a> rather than <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/UTF-8\">UTF-8</a> and which prevented a preference pane from being included in the list of available panes (but only in one of the localizations).</p>\n<p>It might have been possible to catch this with normal unit tests, but only if I ran them all for each localization (which is something I should consider doing in the future anyway). This experience has happened more than once; it is all too easy for encodings to get mucked up in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Xcode\">Xcode</a> because of carelessness.</p>\n<p>So I want to add some &quot;packaging&quot; tests to inspect the built product before it&apos;s considered satisfactory. Things like automatically checking the encoding on <tt>plist</tt> and <tt>strings</tt> files, making sure no expected items are missing from the final bundle, making sure no items which shouldn&apos;t be in the bundle are present (private headers, for instance), and so forth.</p>\n<a name=\"RubyCocoa%20and%20RSpec\"></a><h3>RubyCocoa and RSpec</h3>\n\n<p>Those are exactly the kinds of tests that would be easiest to write in Ruby. In fact, I think that many, many unit tests would be easier to write in Ruby. <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Apple\">Apple</a> is going to up their support of scripting bridges in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard\">Leopard</a> and that means at some point in the future it is going to get a whole lot simpler to bridge between <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Objective-C\">Objective-C</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby\">Ruby</a>.</p>\n<p>Ruby is great for writing tests for two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Everything is an object: this means that you can specify expectations on literally anything at all, even <tt>Fixnum</tt> instances like <tt>1</tt> and <tt>3</tt>, and special values like <tt>nil</tt>, <tt>true</tt> and <tt>false</tt>.</li>\n<li>The amazing <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/RSpec\">RSpec</a> <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/BDD\">BDD</a> framework which leverages the everything-is-an-object design of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby\">Ruby</a> to improve the readability of your specs:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre>#&#xA0;the RSpec way:\nthing.should == &quot;foo&quot;\n\n// the Objective-C way:\nWO_TEST_EQ(thing, @&quot;foo&quot;);</pre>\n<p>There&apos;s nothing wrong with the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Objective-C\">Objective-C</a> way (using <a href=\"http://test.wincent.com/\">WOTest</a>) of course, but the RSpec way is nicer. Note that it works no matter what <tt>thing</tt> is; it can even be <tt>nil</tt> or <tt>false</tt> and the test will work as you would expect. The WOTest version will work too regardless of what <tt>thing</tt> is (it can be a <tt>NULL</tt> pointer, for instance) but it&apos;s not as elegant.</p>\n<p>When I saw <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/RSpec\">RSpec</a> I wanted to modify WOTest to use a similar syntax (<tt>should</tt> and <tt>shouldNot</tt> messages added via a category on <tt>NSObject</tt>) using <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Higher%20Order%20Messaging\">Higher Order Messaging</a> to allow expressions like:</p>\n[[thing should] equal:@&quot;foo&quot;];<p>But this could fall down if <tt>thing</tt> were <tt>nil</tt> and wouldn&apos;t work if <tt>thing</tt> were not an <tt>NSObject</tt> subclass.</p>\n<p>Note that I use a <tt>should</tt> method that returns an anonymous proxy that captures the <tt>equal:</tt> method and then forwards it back to <tt>thing</tt> rather than using a single <tt>shouldEqual:</tt> method. This is to avoid cluttering the <tt>NSObject</tt> namespace.</p>\n<p>I guess it could be done, but you could never go the full distance in Objective-C. That&apos;s one of the reasons I&apos;m looking forward to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard\">Leopard</a>; I&apos;m hoping that the RubyCocoa bridge will allow me to write specs in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby\">Ruby</a> that can be used to test <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Objective-C\">Objective-C</a> objects. Maybe using <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/RSpec\">RSpec</a> itself, or providing a bridge layer to tap into the existing WOTest machinery.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

Unusable. The thing has a list of reproducible, hard-core bugs as long as your arm which I won&apos;t talk about here. When I tried to shut down the thing hung at a blank screen; after waiting about five minutes it was time for a hard reset.

In making this change discovered and fixed a subtle race condition in certain circumstances: the order in which constructors are called is not determinate (or at least it is not publicly documented) so it was possible for another singleton class such as WOLogManager to call the WOSingleton class&apos;s sharedInstance method from it&apos;s constructor function before WOSingleton&apos;s constructor function had been called and before the singleton registry had been set up. Also, the switch to map tables permitted the use of NSMapInsertKnownAbsent which in turn revealed that the sharedInstance and allocWithZone methods were both trying to add the same entry to the singleton registry; this was harmless but redundant so one of the redundant calls has been removed.</p>",

I was about to say, &quot;I don&apos;t know how I ever lived without it&quot;,  but the truth is I <em>do</em> know exactly how I lived without it: I basically avoided <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/branching\">branching</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/merging\">merging</a> and did as little of it as possible.</p>\n<p>That&apos;s a shame because if I had known about <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK\">SVK</a> sooner I could have kept my development process much more nimble: with branches for long-running, disruptive changes on the one hand, and others for stable, release-worthy snapshots at any time.</p>\n<p>I&apos;m afraid I slipped up on this merge by forgetting to pass the <tt>--verbatim</tt> switch to <tt>svk</tt>... So there have been a couple of hundred log messages like <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2007/04/wocommon_r490_2_items_changed.php\">this one</a> which are prepended by some <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK\">SVK</a> metadata (<tt>r1485@cuzco (orig r239): wincent | 2006-12-22 20:17:52 +0100</tt> in this case) that I don&apos;t really want cluttering up my log messages... ah well.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002102more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<a name=\"Bugs\"></a><h3>Bugs</h3>\n\n<p>Of course, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK\">SVK</a> is still not perfect and has its share of bugs. After a couple of hundred changes I got this:</p>\n<pre>Too many open files: Can&apos;t open file &apos;/Users/wincent/.svk/local/db/revs/1262&apos;: Too many open files</pre>\n<p>So fairly obvious there are still some resource leakage issues to be taken care of.</p>\n<p>On trying again:</p>\n<pre>Transaction is out of date: Out of date: &apos;/trunk/WOBaseCore/WOSingleton+WOBaseCore.m&apos; in transaction &apos;538-1&apos;\nPlease sync mirrored path /mirrors/WOCommon/trunk first.</pre>\n<p>I had to perform the suggested <tt>sync</tt> before proceeding:</p>\n<pre>svk sync -a //mirrors/WOCommon</pre>\n<a name=\"Conclusion\"></a><h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>But little glitches aside, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK\">SVK</a> is a great tool. For the most part it&apos;s just a case of firing off the merge and resolving the occasional conflict; and conflict resolution is a pleasure thanks to the tight integration with <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Apple\">Apple</a>&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/FileMerge\">FileMerge</a>. <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion\">Subversion</a> 1.5 is around the corner and will finally bring some rudimentary <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/merge%20tracking\">merge tracking</a> facilities, but it still has a long way to go to catch up with <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK\">SVK</a>.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>In &quot;<a href=\"http://chanson.livejournal.com/169786.html\">Disable assertions and logging in your Release build</a>&quot; <a href=\"http://chanson.livejournal.com/\">Chris Hanson</a> makes the case for, um, Disabling assertions and logging in your release builds. He later follows this up with &quot;<a href=\"http://chanson.livejournal.com/170068.html\">Distinguish between checks and assertions</a>&quot;.</p>\n<p>For my first couple of years as a Cocoa programmer I almost never used assertions. When I wanted to test for programming errors I would do an explicit test, create an exception and explicitly raise it. This was fairly verbose so I didn&apos;t do it very often.</p>\n<p>Then I discovered the joy of assertions and have been using them increasingly over the last few years. It&apos;s part of the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/fail%20early\">fail early</a> philosophy that complements <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/unit%20testing\">unit testing</a> so well.</p>\n<p>I never used to turn off assertions in release builds because I figured the speed hit was negligible, and I wanted my shipping code to be the same code that I had tested during development. Why test one thing and then ship something different to customers?</p>\n<p>But as my projects have grown larger I&apos;ve leaned towards turning off assertions in release builds for two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If your testing processes are adequate then it should be safe to turn off assertions in release builds. In other words, not having them in your shipping code should only be a problem if that code is buggy; if you make testing an integral part of the development process then you won&apos;t be shipping buggy code.</li>\n<li>As your projects get bigger then it becomes more desirable to reduce your memory footprint and save a few CPU cycles in order to get better performance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I haven&apos;t yet shipped a product with assertions disabled, but I have been thinking about doing so soon. Reading Chris&apos;s post made me realize that there is still a little more work to be done before I can go ahead and flip the switch. Chris uses the example of a method that should throw an <tt>NSRangeException</tt> if passed an out-of-range input parameter:</p>\n<blockquote>You might be tempted to implement this using a form of assertion, since by default assertions in Cocoa will throw an exception. But remember, this is part of the API contract of your class, not just an internal detail that should never go wrong! Thus if you do implement this using an assertion, and you disable assertions in your Release build, your Release build will wind up implementing your API incorrectly.</blockquote>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002114more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>My problem is that I have been using <tt>NSParameterAssert</tt> extensively for a long time now to enforce the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/API\">API</a> contract of my classes. That is, I generally have three aspects that must all match up:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Inline <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Doxygen\">Doxygen</a> documentation which states, &quot;If passed <tt>X</tt> raises <tt>Y</tt>&quot;.</li>\n<li>Unit tests which check that if passed <tt>X</tt>, does indeed raise Y.</li>\n<li>In the implementation itself, use of <tt>NSParameterAssert</tt> to raise <tt>Y</tt> if passed <tt>X</tt>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once I turn off assertions in release builds my unit tests will break and my implementation will no longer conform to the description in the documentation.</p>\n<p>So drat, I now have to make a new macro, let&apos;s call it <tt>WOParameterCheck</tt> and use it to replace all my calls to <tt>NSParameterAssert</tt>. <tt>WOParameterCheck</tt> will remain active even when assertions are turned off. I guess I fell into this trap because the name <tt>NSParameterAssert</tt> made me think about parameters and API contracts. And it was just too darn convenient.</p>\n<p>My code already had a very clean division between assertions, error conditions and exceptions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assertions are for checking for programming errors: a failed assertion is evidence of a programming error or an incorrect assumption (which itself is just a class of programming error). That is, a failed assertion is always &quot;my fault&quot;.</li>\n<li>Exceptions are for signalling unexpected conditions outside the control of the programmer: you should be prepared to catch exceptions and deal with them appropriately. Exceptions are for things that are <em>not</em> &quot;my fault&quot;, but I should be prepared to deal with them (and failure to do so is once again &quot;my fault&quot;).</li>\n<li>Error conditions: every time you make a call to another API you should be prepared to check the return value for an error code or <tt>nil</tt> return value. Error conditions are just like exceptions in the sense that they signal unexpected conditions outside of your control. Likewise, even though the error condition is not &quot;your fault&quot;, failure to handle it makes it so.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Evidently my use of <tt>NSParameterAssert</tt> made the separation not clean enough, by blurring the line between assertions and exceptions. I guess we&apos;ll just have to add this to the &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Don%27t_repeat_the_mistakes_I_made\">Don&apos;t repeat the mistakes I made</a>&quot; list.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

Rather than releasing 0.5 I&apos;m going to jump straight ahead to 0.5.1b because I want to include some minor new features.</p>\n\n<h4>Dock options</h4>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=1219&amp;page=1#Post1221\">explained here</a>, there are a number of reasons why the latest Synergy Advance release (0.5b) no longer has the ability to hide the Dock icon (in summary: this has always been a bit hackish in previous versions of the operating system, but when Leopard comes out it is going to be downright broken).</p>\n\n<p>It will still be possible to manually alter the application&apos;s <tt>Info.plist</tt> file if you really want to hide the Dock icon, but I&apos;ll no longer be providing a user interface to do this from within the application. In order to make this change easier to live with I have been adding ever more features to the Dock icon, many of which are visible in the 0.5b release. Today I&apos;ve been working on adding a user-customizable Dock menu; the intention is that the Dock icon becomes so useful that you won&apos;t want to hide it:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"dock-options.png\" src=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/dock-options.png\" width=\"291\" height=\"212\"></p>\n\n<h4>More hot keys</h4>\n\n<p>People have been <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/support/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=240\">requesting more ways</a> of setting half-star ratings. Today I&apos;ve implemented additional hot keys and a couple of menu-based ways of applying half-star ratings are well on the way:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"more-hot-keys.png\" src=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/more-hot-keys.png\" width=\"291\" height=\"168\"></p>\n\n<div id=\"a002127more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>I was just randomly browsing the <a href=\"http://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/\">HexFiend</a> source when the <a href=\"http://ridiculousfish.com/svn/HexFiend/trunk/sources/threading/FishThread.m\">following snippet</a> caught my eye:</p>\n\n<pre>- (BOOL)shouldEnd {\n\treturn !!([myThreadStatus flag] &amp; SHOULD_END);\n}</pre>\n\n<p>Why the double negation (<tt>!!</tt>)? It&apos;s actually very clever. I don&apos;t know if this is a common idiom or not; I guess so, but I had never seen it before.</p>\n\n<h4>The problem</h4>\n\n<p>What might be your first impulse if you want to check if a bit is set?</p>\n\n<pre>variable &amp; mask</pre>\n\n<p>This will work, kind of, for most cases. Maybe you like being explicit (as I do) and so you explicitly show the type of the expression:</p>\n\n<pre>(BOOL)(variable &amp; mask)</pre>\n\n<p>Bzzzzt... You&apos;ve just made a hidden bug a little bit more visible. <tt>BOOL</tt> is actually just an <tt>unsigned char</tt> and so any time the expression overflows the 8-bit limit of <tt>unsigned char</tt> your cast to <tt>BOOL</tt> <em>will throw away the most significant bits</em>. Let&apos;s say <tt>variable &amp; mask</tt> evaluates to 8192; casting (<tt>(BOOL)8192</tt>) returns <tt>0</tt> (<tt>NO</tt>)... most likely not what you wanted...</p>\n\n<p>The explicit cast makes this overflow risk easier to spot, but the same bug is present if the expression is in a method:</p>\n\n<pre>- (BOOL)foobar\n{\n    return (variable &amp; mask);\n}</pre>\n\n<p>Or a macro:</p>\n\n<pre>#define AT_LEAST_ONE_BIT_SET(variable, mask) ((BOOL)(variable &amp; mask))</pre>\n\n<h4>The solution</h4>\n\n<p>One way to fix this is to use an equality test:</p>\n\n<pre>(variable &amp; mask) != 0</pre>\n\n<p>This doesn&apos;t suffer from the overflow problems caused by an explicit (or implicit) cast to <tt>BOOL</tt>, and it returns what you want: a <tt>BOOL</tt>-compatible value that equates to either <tt>YES</tt> or <tt>NO</tt>.</p>\n\n<h4>The HexFiend solution</h4>\n\n<p>The trick used in HexFiend is another way of avoiding unwanted overflow errors. The first negation safely converts the value of the expression from <tt>YES</tt> or <tt>NO</tt> to its opposite with no risk of overflow. This is because the compiler knows how big the value is and it also knows how to avoid overflow errors. The second negation inverts the sense back to its original form again, <tt>YES</tt> or <tt>NO</tt>, and again there&apos;s obviously no risk of overflow errors sneaking in.</p>\n\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n\n<p>Which one do you like better? The HexFiend pattern is more concise, very clever, but it may not be evident at first glance why a double-negation is employed.</p>\n\n<p>The other pattern is less opaque (nothing in it to make you look twice; but then again, the incorrect cast-to-<tt>BOOL</tt> didn&apos;t make you look twice either and it contained a hidden bug) but more verbose.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a002170more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Today I felt like showing off my stunning ignorance of Ruby on Rails by doing a screencast on Behaviour-Driven Development.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/screencasts/BDD.mov\" onclick=\"window.open(&apos;http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/screencasts/BDD.mov&apos;,&apos;popup&apos;); return false\"><img alt=\"bdd-screencast.png\" src=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/bdd-screencast.png\" width=\"427\" height=\"360\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Well, not really. Showing the world how slow and clumsy I am in Rails wasn&apos;t my prime objective (even though I did do a pretty good job of it!)</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;m parading my ignorance because I want to convey something about Behaviour-Driven Development: I am convinced that <em>it is the best approach a beginner can take to a new task</em>, especially if he or she already has programming experience from other fields. It helps you have excellent code coverage, have confidence that your code does what you think it does, and saves you from writing code that you won&apos;t ever need.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it&apos;s not only good for beginners, even if that&apos;s where it really shines. With the help of autotest, an experienced coder can blaze ahead writing specs and code in parallel and getting continuous feedback. Even a beginner can get into a very quick spec-code-confirm cycle and get real work done very quickly.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, I wish that I could work this way in Objective-C too... I do try to use a continuous integration approach there, and I do run tests continuously in the background (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/04/test_process_im.php\">see this article for more details</a>), but Objective-C is a compiled language and that&apos;s always going to limit your turnaround time.</p>\n\n<p>The screencast isn&apos;t perfect, but it&apos;s an accurate representation of the way you work in BDD. You think about the behaviour you want to implement, write specs to describe the behaviour, make assertions to confirm the behaviour is implemented, confirm that the specs fail (because you haven&apos;t written the code yet), <em>then</em> write the code, and finally confirm that the specs now pass.</p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of errors in the screencast, and it&apos;s a one-take affair, but that accurately reflects the reality of the development process. You stop and think. You forget things. You make mistakes. You don&apos;t always do things the best possible way on your first attempt. But the key take-home lesson here is that BDD provides a great big safety net underneath you that allows you to blaze ahead with great confidence even when you don&apos;t really know what you&apos;re doing.</p>\n\n<p>Before I sign off, there&apos;s only one thing I forgot to demonstrate which I wish I had; in the screencast I showed an unimplemented example which looked like this:</p>\n\n<pre>it &apos;should...&apos; do\nend</pre>\n\n<p>What I really should have done is omit the block:</p>\n\n<pre>it &apos;should...&apos;</pre>\n\n<p>Then RSpec would have issued a new status message showing that the example wasn&apos;t fleshed out yet:</p>\n\n<pre>29 examples, 0 failures, 1 not implemented</pre>\n\n<h4>Update</h4>\n\n<p>David Chelimsky <a href=\"http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rspec-users/2007-May/001650.html\">explains</a> how to get failing examples to run only once (until a change is made).</p>\n\n<div id=\"a002185more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

The debugging console pops up right in the Mongrel process. Looks really good and powerful.

The _include_tags now have a :cache=&gt;true option that combines JS and CSS files together and gzips them to drastically improve performance.</li>\n<li>ActiveRecord QueryCache. Caches queries that have already been executed for performance boost.</li>\n<li>Renderers and mime types not conflated in the naming of the view templates anymore. (Refers to the new .erb and .builder extensions)</li>\n<li>Better config and initializer directory structure cleans up the mess of environment.rb</li>\n<li>Sexy migrations! Big improvement in the syntax of migration files and an example of a 3rd party plugin making it into core very quickly.</li>\n<li>Much better HTTP authentication support baked in.</li>\n<li>MIT license assumed now. Plugin generator script adds the MIT license by default.</li>\n<li>Spring cleaning. Improvements to basic Rails code and lots of 1.2 deprecations being moved out completely now.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of these, the performance improvements are always welcome, the debugging stuff could prove useful, the improved migrations sound appealing, but the thing which I most care about is the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/API\">API</a>: will there be a lot of breakage in the move to 2.0?

Now, I&apos;m not personally in the market for a portable right now but I still think it&apos;s awesome the rate at which Apple&apos;s improving their hardware nowadays. Not like the dark and gloomy Motorola days when disappointing product announcements were made with great fanfare at MacWorld; now Apple routinely rolls out significant, regular hardware upgrades as a matter of course.</p>\n<p>The new MacBook Pro is significantly more powerful than my own Intel desktop machine (an iMac) which is just over a year old. Comparing the two:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The MacBook Pro has the same screen size (17&quot;).</li>\n<li>The MacBook Pro has higher resolution (1680 by 1050, compared with 1440 by 900 on the iMac); you can optionally take it even higher to an impressive 1920 by 1200 via a built-to-order option. </li>\n<li>The MacBook Pro has a considerably faster clockspeed (2.4 GHz dual compared with 1.8 GHz dual on the iMac) as well as the architectural improvements gained in the move from the Core Duo to the Core 2 Duo.</li>\n<li>The MacBook Pro comes with 2 GB of memory, standard, and can be upgraded to 4 GB;  the iMac came with only 512 MB which crippled machine performance (I upgraded to the 2 GB maximum as soon as possible).</li>\n<li>The MacBook Pro comes with a 160 GB hard drive, as large as the iMac&apos;s drive; and upgradeable to 250 GB.</li>\n<li>The MacBook Pro comes with everything the iMac has: slot-loading SuperDrive, built-in iSight, Gigabit ethernet, AirPort Extreme (but the superior 802.11n standard, I believe the iMac came with the previous generation of 802.11), multiple USB 2.0, FireWire 800 and FireWire 400 ports, infrared remote.</li>\n<li>And of course, some things you can&apos;t get on an iMac: the MagSafe power adapter and illuminated keyboard.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All in all, an impressive machine. Admittedly it costs more than a lowly iMac, but it packs one hell of a punch for such a small package.

Cross the 160 character limit and you&apos;ll have to pay another 15 cents for each additional block of 160 characters.</p>\n<p>Sure, this sucks, and I suspect that the true cost to the network operators for transmitting each message is probably down around 0.1 cents or thereabouts.</p>\n<p>But there is a bright side. The cost of sending an SMS message largely explains why I only get around one SMS &quot;spam&quot; per month.</p>\n<p>Compare this with electronic mail (referred to as <em>email</em> by some) which is free. I get a few thousand spam in that medium per month; almost all are filtered into a spam box where I don&apos;t have to think about them and several hundred per day are blocked at the server before delivery is even completed. But even though the spam epidemic is largely &quot;under control&quot;, there&apos;s no denying that the quantities involved are almost absurdly large.</p>\n<p>Now think about what would happen if sending each message cost the spammer 15 cents. A spam run with 5 million victims would suddenly cost a whopping 750,000 euros. The amount of email-borne spam would fall drastically.</p>\n<p>But don&apos;t get me wrong: I&apos;m not advocating that someone start charging 15 cents for each email we send; I&apos;m merely observing that if I only get one SMS-borne spam per month then the reason for it is economic. And as much as I dislike the network operators&apos; price-gouging on SMS messages (don&apos;t believe for one second that they&apos;re doing this for our benefit), I can also recognize the bright side of the equation.</p>\n<p>And of course, I like email and I hate sending SMS (darn tiny keyboards); that&apos;s one more reason why the inflated price doesn&apos;t bother me too much.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002205more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Normally I don&apos;t install pre-release software on my production machine. I used to be a real dabbler, what I considered then to be a &quot;Power User&quot;; I had all the latest hacks and extensions, knew every trick and shortcut, and had my computer decked out like a custom dragster with flames painted down the sides of it.</p>\n<p>But ever since becoming a developer I&apos;ve had to keep things as stock as possible. My machine is as vanilla as they come; nothing pre-release installed and as little third-party software as possible. This sometimes means that I miss out on some great stuff, but it&apos;s the price of having a stable, neutral platform on which to develop and test my software.</p>\n<p>In the case of the Safari 3.0 beta I&apos;ll be making an exception (typing this in the beta right now, actually) for a couple of reasons. The most important of these is that Apple provides an uninstaller package to back out if things don&apos;t turn out. This software <em>will</em> have bugs. It&apos;s just a matter of seeing if they&apos;re show stoppers or not.</p>\n<p>Of all the sexy new features in Safari 3.0, the one that makes me want to be able to run it is, believe it or not, the find-in-page functionality. I don&apos;t know, maybe I&apos;m getting old, but I find it increasingly frustrating to find tiny snippets of text in a sea of letters highlighted by a light blue box on a white background. The new find-in-page functionality addresses the issue perfectly.</p>\n<p>The other stuff is really just icing on the cake:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reorderable tabs: convenient for those occasional moments when you want to;</li>\n<li>The ability to drag a tab out into a separate window: again, nice for the one or two times a day that you&apos;ll want to do it;</li>\n<li>Better performance and even better standards compliance: always welcome;</li>\n<li>More intelligent autocomplete in the location bar (it&apos;s not just a simple most-recent-match-wins any more).</li>\n<li>An unsaved document indicator in the window close gadget for when you have unsaved form data.</li>\n<li>Warning before closing a window with multiple tabs (how many times have you accidentally blown away a pile of in progress research by mistake); this stuff is really important as the browser becomes the new platform for real application use.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So I&apos;ve already encountered a few bugs, but I at least intend to trial this for a day or two. I hope it works out.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002258more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Seeing as every man and his dog has or is going to opine on the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/keynote/\">WWDC keynote</a> I don&apos;t think it&apos;s necessary for me to add anything here.</p>\n<p>My dog, however, feels differently, so I&apos;m going to hand over to him:</p>\n<blockquote>I was a little underwhelmed by the keynote. A year after we were told that Leopard had some &quot;Top Secret&quot; stuff still waiting to be uncovered I expected some big things. Jobs boasted that Leopard had 300 &quot;new features&quot; and that he was going to show us 10 of them. Alas, 8 of the 10 features were things we&apos;d already seen one year ago at WWDC 2006.</blockquote>\n<a name=\"The%20new%20Dock\"></a><h3>The new Dock</h3>\n\n<blockquote>The Dock has come a long, long way from the early days of the first Mac OS X Developer Previews. This latest iteration is evolutionary, not revolutionary, but it&apos;s still a welcome change. It&apos;s improved in two ways: firstly, it looks better (you can see how much Apple has learned from Cover Flow); secondly; &quot;stacks&quot; are at once a replacement for the much-missed pop-up folders from OS 9 and also an incarnation of Apple&apos;s famous &quot;piles&quot; patents. Stacks don&apos;t just look cool, I think they&apos;ll actually be extremely useful. I think they combine the best of OS 9&apos;s pop-up windows with the flexibility of the NeXT shelf; you&apos;re not just looking at a static folder, but at an arbitrarily configurable collection of objects.</blockquote>\n<a name=\"The%20new%20Finder\"></a><h3>The new Finder</h3>\n\n<blockquote>The much pined-for Finder rewrite is here at last. Is it Carbon like iTunes? Or Cocoa like iPhoto? Who cares? iTunes and iPhoto are proof that it&apos;s possible to write best-of-class applications in either Carbon or Cocoa. Apple pioneered a lot of things in iTunes; making it easy to navigate vast collections of files at lightning speed, intuitively and flexibly. Applying those lessons to the file browser is a good move. It gets a definite thumbs-up from me. And amazing to see how far they&apos;ve taken the Cover Flow idea.</blockquote>\n<a name=\"ZFS\"></a><h3>ZFS</h3>\n\n<blockquote>No mention of ZFS. A storm in a teacup. The Time Machine demo on the Apple website shows the Time Machine is still just a backup tool for copying to a second volume. This is not powered by ZFS snapshots under the hood. There is a simple explanation for <a href=\"http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/\">Jonathan Schwartz&apos;s</a> statement about ZFS the other day: Apple was <em>never</em> going to make ZFS the default (bootable) filesystem in the Leopard timeframe; the only evidence we had was a posting by an Apple guy to a mailing list that they wanted to port, and various signs in the other Leopard seeds that implementation was underway. No public statements had yet been made. What Schwartz meant was that Apple would finally be making public statements that ZFS would be supported (but not as a boot volume).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Well, in the end no public statements were made. The rest of WWDC will be under NDA so I don&apos;t expect any statements to be made either. Perhaps Jobs is upset with Schwartz for inadvertently stealing his thunder. It&apos;s happened before (think ATI).</blockquote>\n<a name=\"Safari%20on%20Windows\"></a><h3>Safari on Windows</h3>\n\n<blockquote>Puzzling, puzzling, puzzling. This is like the neighbourhood computer store purchasing a corner inside the Dell staff cafeteria and opening up a stall. David dropping by at Goliath&apos;s house proposing a few quick rounds of sumo wrestling. Why? Firefox already has the mindshare of those disgruntled IE-haters who run Windows. The only possible reason I can think of is that Safari is the new application platform for the iPhone, and this is an indirect way of getting more potential developers for that.</blockquote>\n<a name=\"The%20rest\"></a><h3>The rest</h3>\n\n<blockquote>The remaining 8 new features that Steve talked about are all old news. Spaces will be great (virtual desktops done right) and a great complement to Expos&#xE9; and the Dashboard. Core Animation will enable some cool stuff and will also be abused. Brushed metal is gone (yay!). The Terminal has tabs (nerds rejoice).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Quicklook will be extremely handy: again evolution of the existing preview mechanisms rather than revolution. This is probably the way it should be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Making the menu bar transparent is an obvious move that will make the Desktop seem bigger and deeper. I haven&apos;t seen it in action yet but I imagine it will become more opaque when you mouse over it. Again, evolution and polish rather than evolution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The live coverage provided by <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/\">MacRumors</a> was awesome; almost as good as being there. They are the ones to tune in to next time we want to see a keynote and there&apos;s no webcast.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>So, my socks weren&apos;t knocked off but I am still very much looking forward to Leopard. Tiger is currently the best desktop operating system in the world, and far better than Vista, but Leopard will be upping the ante and incresing the lead even further. I am quite looking forward to it. I just hope the beta is stable enough to actually do development work on...</blockquote>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002259more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

Once you get right down inside the scroll ball component and see the black gunk bonded to the magnetic rollers, you&apos;ll see that there is no way to clean it without taking it apart.</p>\n<p>So thankfully, after over a week without scrolling functionality in any direction, I&apos;m happy to have a working scroll ball again.</p>\n<p>Despite their diminutive size, manipulating the rollers isn&apos;t the hardest part, provided you have on hand a set of tweezers or needle-nose pliers.

Actually, I only wanted one, but then I saw that they had a &quot;<a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/oreilly/cs/b2g1f.html\">Buy 2, get a 3rd book free</a>&quot; offer.</p>\n<p>I really only wanted a quick <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/htmlpr3/\">HTML reference</a>, but seeing as the offer was there  I had a quick look to see if any other pocket references would come in handy, and ended up picking the <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/jscriptpr2/\">JavaScript</a> and <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/csspr2/\">CSS</a> references as well.</p>\n<p>On proceeding to the checkout I saw that the prices were actually lower than the ones on the pages linked to above: $6.49 and $4.99. So getting one of them for free yielded a total of $11.48.</p>\n<p>I can&apos;t recommend the O&apos;Reilly Pocket References highly enough. I have a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/01/my_favorite_pro.php\">worn, paper copy</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cpr/\">C reference</a>. It&apos;s never lead me astray. I also have a paper copy (somewhat less worn) of the <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cpluspluspr/\">C++ reference</a>.</p>\n<p>The publishing world is changing thanks to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/PDF\">PDF</a>. I still prefer printed books for cases where you&apos;re going to have sustained reading sessions (on a bus, on a train, on the couch, in bed, wherever) but for reference works where you want to consult something quickly nothing beats PDF. Instant searchability. It&apos;s interesting to compare the way I use my (printed) C pocket reference (straight to Index, then to page) compared with the way I&apos;ve been using the (PDF) HTML reference (using the table of contents in the Preview drawer). The latter is a much, much better way of working. All this, and you&apos;re not consuming any physical resources (paper).</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002262more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>So a new <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WordPress\">WordPress</a> release is out with the usual <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/development/2007/06/wordpress-221/\">spin</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>Since 2.2 was released a month ago, the WordPress community has been improving fit-and-finish by identifying and fixing those little bugs that can be so annoying and by fine-tuning some small details. The result is a nicely polished 2.2.1 release.</blockquote>\n<p>But wait, there&apos;s more! A little further down we see:</p>\n<blockquote>Unfortunately, 2.2.1 is not just a bug fix release. Some security issues came to light during 2.2.1 development, making 2.2.1 a required upgrade.</blockquote>\n<p>This is not the first <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/04/wordpress_213_b.php\">security disgrace</a> for <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WordPress\">WordPress</a> and it&apos;s exactly this kind of flaw which makes it impossible to recommend <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WordPress\">WordPress</a> as a public-facing <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/web\">web</a> application. In fact, it&apos;s not just that I can&apos;t recommend installing it; it&apos;s that it would be irresponsible to do anything but recommend that people <em>uninstall</em> it.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/4039\">exploit</a> for one of the flaws was published on 6 June. The exploit demonstrates how any user with an account can get the login names, password hashes, and authentication cookies for <em>every user in the database</em>. The exploit describes the flaw as &quot;bastante tonto por cierto&quot; (&quot;pretty dumb, that&apos;s for sure&quot;).</p>\n<p>The flaw was publicly disclosed on 6 June. It turns out that the security researcher in question privately notified the WordPress developers beforehand, and a <a href=\"http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset/5570\">patch</a> was checked into the trunk on 28 May.</p>\n<p>Comments on the <a href=\"http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4357\">corresponding ticket</a> show that by 8 June the WordPress team knew that the flaw and exploit was known to be &quot;Now widely published&quot;. Yet they waited until 21 June to prepare a new release.</p>\n<p>This flaw should never have crept into the code base; it&apos;s an elementary <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SQL\">SQL</a> injection attack. And once in the code base, it should have been caught by review. But it didn&apos;t get caught, and the WordPress team sat on the fix for nearly a month before advising people to upgrade; during just over two of those weeks an exploit was widely disseminated.</p>\n<p>Even though the new release is now out, many won&apos;t upgrade and there will be countless script kiddies using <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Google\">Google</a> to <a href=\"http://kev.coolcavemen.com/2007/06/wordpress-22-security-hole-identity-theft/\">find vulnerable installs</a>. A friend of mine got bitten by this recently when someone walked in and took over his install using a exploit for a long-since-patched hole; he simply didn&apos;t realize that you had to upgrade WordPress regularly or risk getting owned. He didn&apos;t realize that when you install a public-facing web application it&apos;s like choosing a lock for your house; it&apos;s a good idea to choose carefully.</p>\n<p>All of this leads to one simple conclusion: if you want install to WordPress on a public-facing web server, don&apos;t. And if you insist on installing it, then you need to watch the <a href=\"http://trac.wordpress.org/\">trac</a> like a hawk and be ready to patch faulty files as soon as flaws are discovered, because the WordPress team simply doesn&apos;t take security seriously. Even then you won&apos;t be safe because there will always be undiscovered flaws and you never know when someone might come knocking. I am not the only one who <a href=\"http://fukamachi.org/wp/2007/06/21/yet-another-wordpress-exploit/\">thinks this</a>.</p>\n<p>If you do want to install <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/weblog\">weblog</a> software, I recommend <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Movable%20Type\">Movable Type</a>. It is possible to set up a very secure install if you don&apos;t need things like comments (see &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Movable%20Type%20security%20notes\">Movable Type security notes</a>&quot;). If you do, well, you should probably just use <a href=\"http://blogger.com/\">Blogger</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002265more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

Matt seems to have missed my single major gripe about WordPress, and I don&apos;t blame him for not seeing it as you really need to have taken this alongside my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/04/wordpress_213_b.php\">previous post</a> on WordPress. Let me explain.</p>\n<p>He says, &quot;I think the real issue though is not that WP has bugs which are sometimes security related ... but that the mechanisms for updating complex web software are a pain.&quot; </p>\n<p>Totally true, all software has bugs. Also true that updating web software is a pain. But that&apos;s not my complaint. My complaint is that the WordPress team needs to improve their <em>process</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>I suppose we could act more like our proprietary competitors and try to downplay or hide security issues instead of trumpeting them loudly in our blog, but I think the benefit of having people well-informed outweighs the PR lumps we take for doing the right thing.</blockquote>\n<p>I wouldn&apos;t accuse the WordPress team of hiding security issues (although I <em>do</em> believe that they downplay them), but I <em>do</em> think they need to change what they&apos;re doing. My beliefs on this are pretty much exactly what I said <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/04/wordpress_213_b.php\">last time</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>The WordPress team needs to change the way they work with respect to security. This is a very popular, public-facing web application. Instead of springing these forced security updates (&quot;upgrade now or else&quot;) on the masses they should do three or four things:\n<ol>\n<li>Adopt a regular, public update schedule for security updates so that people can plan and be ready for security updates. Something simple like &quot;first Tuesday of every month&quot;.</li>\n<li>Have a core-team-only security branch which is merged into the publicly-viewable branches only just before release. More on this point below.</li>\n<li>Implement a mandatory review process in which every single check-in must pass a security review by another team member; this security-specific review should be in addition to any existing review procedures they might have (emphasis on the might).</li>\n<li>Appoint a security officer whose responsibilities include a coordinating regular, pro-active audits of the code base.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Open%20source\">Open source</a> is great, but that doesn&apos;t mean that total transparency at every single moment is the best thing. Consider one of the iconic open source stars, the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mozilla\">Mozilla</a> project: almost everything is out in the open but security issues are tracked privately and only exposed to the public eye <em>after</em> the release of the updated software containing the fix. They do this because they know that attackers would otherwise mine the <a href=\"http://bugzilla.mozilla.org\">Bugzilla database</a> looking for information that will help them craft exploits.</p>\n<p>This approach would be doubly appropriate for WordPress because unlike a web browser, a WordPress weblog is always on, always exposed. No exploit can attack a flawed copy of Firefox if your computer is turned off and you&apos;re living it up in a disco in Ibiza; but if you&apos;re running WordPress and go off on a camping trip then your server is beyond your reach, naked, on the Internet with nothing but the guarantees of the WordPress team that the code has been audited and is hopefully vulnerability free, &quot;fingers crossed&quot;.</p>\n<p>This, combined with a regular release schedule, would make the pain of upgrading much easier to plan for and accommodate. And as Sho Fukamachi <a href=\"http://fukamachi.org/wp/2007/06/21/yet-another-wordpress-exploit/\">writes</a>, if you upgrade via <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion\">Subversion</a> then it&apos;s really not that difficult (for tips on doing this, see &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Upgrading%20WordPress%20using%20Subversion\">Upgrading WordPress using Subversion</a>&quot;).</p>\n<p>One last thing; Matt says:</p>\n<blockquote>Wincent Colaiuta has no problem throwing flames at WordPress, but doesn&apos;t see fit to enable comments. (Apparently disabled to make Movable Type more secure.)</blockquote>\n<p>It&apos;s not that I disabled comments <em>in order to</em> increase security; it&apos;s that I didn&apos;t want comments in the first place, and then <em>later</em> recognized that a side-effect of this was the possibility of locking down an installation. I understand that for many people comments are a quintessential part of weblogging &#x2014; I myself have run weblogs in the past with comments enabled &#x2014; but there are also plenty of examples of sites that explicitly choose not to enable comments because they&apos;re not looking for a &quot;conversation&quot; with anonymous strangers. <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Daring%20Fireball\">Daring Fireball</a> is a relatively high-profile example of this latter school.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002268more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

I&apos;ve transcribed the relevant snippet from about the 55 minute mark, with some minor edits for clarity (seeing as this was a live, unscripted podcast and not polished writing):</p>\n<blockquote><strong>Gruber:</strong> One of the complaints I used to get all the time back in 2002, 2003 is, &quot;You don&apos;t have comments on your website. You know your site is not really a blog because it doesn&apos;t have comments&quot;, and I would just email them back and say, &quot;OK, it&apos;s not a blog&quot;.\n<p>The accusation whenever I write something that calls somebody a jackass or is rather harsh to somebody I occasionally get accusations that I&apos;m a coward, that I&apos;m afraid of having comments. Well it&apos;s not like me not having comments keeps you from calling me a jackass. I mean, you know, there&apos;s the whole internet out there. It&apos;s not about being afraid of criticism.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is that I wanted to write a site where, somebody who it was meant for, the reader I write it for is a second version of me who never quite off the &quot;you know I should do a weblog&quot;, which is what I&apos;d been doing up until 2002 for quite a long time, thinking, &quot;I should write a weblog I really should&quot;.</p>\n<p>And so I have this version of me and I&apos;m writing for him. He&apos;s interested in the exact same things I&apos;m interested in, he reads the other same websites I read, and my thought is I&apos;m writing for him and I want him to like this website so much that he reads it from the top to the bottom, and he reads everything I write. He reads every word of it, and he goes through the menu, and every single word, I mean literally: the copyright statement, what software I use to use this, he&apos;s read it all. And it&apos;s easy to see it all, it&apos;s easy to know how much of it there is.</p>\n<p>And if I turned comments on that goes away. It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t like sites with comments, but when you read a site with comments, it automatically puts you the reader in a defensive mode where you&apos;re saying, &quot;What&apos;s good in this comment thread? What can I skim?&quot; and you&apos;re automatically in skimming mode.</p>\n<p>And it&apos;s totally egotistical, I mean, I want Daring Fireball to be a site that you can&apos;t skim if you&apos;re in the target audience for it; that it&apos;s a site where you say, &quot;Oh, a new article from john, I gotta read it&quot;, your deadlines go whizzing by because you need to read what I wrote.</p>\n<p>I mean that&apos;s what I want and if I turned comments on I feel like it&apos;s sort of like two different directions. You get to the end of my article and then all of a sudden you&apos;re like, &quot;Let&apos;s see if anybody interesting, if I see any names I know&quot;.</p>\nSo that&apos;s really it. Sometimes a design decision is what you don&apos;t put in as opposed to what you put in, and that&apos;s more or less why there&apos;s no comments.</blockquote>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002269more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>I partly share John&apos;s reasoning on this one. I&apos;m not really writing this weblog for anybody but others exactly like me, people who are interested in what I&apos;m interested in, think like I think, and would like to know things which I know. Often I write stuff not because I feel I have to say it, but because I&apos;d like it if someone said it to me. </p>\n<p>But another reason I have which John doesn&apos;t mention is that I&apos;m simply not interested in having the kind of &quot;conversation&quot; that you \nhave with anonymous strangers on the Internet in weblog comments. The &quot;conversations&quot; I like to have on the Internet are either with people that I personally know (via chat or email, for example), or with people who share a specific interest in a very specific technical topic (as is the case on mailing lists).</p>\n<p>And as John says, it&apos;s not fear of people disagreeing with me. It&apos;s not that I wish to avoid criticism; it&apos;s that I think that the act of arguing is almost always a poor use of time (see <a href=\"http://carcino.gen.nz/images/index.php/00b9a680/463c5922\">this image</a>; beware: it&apos;s politically incorrect): I say &quot;A&quot;, you say &quot;B&quot;, and in 99% of cases at the end of all this I continue believing &quot;A&quot; and you continue to believe &quot;B&quot;. I figure that if people feel strongly enough about what I&apos;ve written that they feel compelled to contact me then my email address (win@wincent.com) is plastered all over this website. In this way the feedback that does reach me tends to be the kind that I am more likely to be interested in. And as John says, if you want your comments to be public then there&apos;s the whole Internet out there.</p>\n<p>A particularly good example of this is the <a href=\"http://photomatt.net/2007/06/22/on-wp-security/\">storm-in-a-teacup</a> caused by my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/06/wordpress_flaw.php\">WordPress article</a>. I criticize <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WordPress\">WordPress</a>, the author provides a reasoned response, and then dozens of pseudo-anonymous observers decide to jump in on the discussion. I am just not interested in sinking down into the endless black well that this kind of discussion represents, and I am even less interested in actually <em>hosting</em> such arguments on my own weblog.</p>\n<p>If I wanted an example of why I&apos;m don&apos;t have comments on my weblog then I couldn&apos;t hope for a better example than <a href=\"http://photomatt.net/2007/06/22/on-wp-security/\">this case in point</a>, being as it is a very pro-<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WordPress\">WordPress</a> site, and I had just criticized <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WordPress\">WordPress</a>.</p>\n<a name=\"Insults\"></a><h3>Insults</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;he crazy&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;that Vincent guy is a bit of a moron&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;He sounds like an idiot with an axe to grind&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;stupid post&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;inflamatory nonsense&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;What a loser.

I think that if people misread my argument in a subtle way then it&apos;s an indication that I could have expressed myself more clearly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;I can see why it was necessary for him to link to his own KB, instead of just linking directly to wordpress.org&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I often link to articles in the <a href=\"http://kbase.wincent.com/\">Knowledge Base</a> rather than linking directly to an external site because it allows me to provide annotated links rather than plain ones, although in the case of the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WordPress\">WordPress</a> there is nothing much to see (other than the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Category:WordPress\">category link</a> which itself reveals quite a few WordPress-related articles).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;Did the WP team steal his first born or something?&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lots of people got the impression that I was angry, &quot;harsh&quot; or &quot;whining&quot; and I didn&apos;t mean to convey either of those emotions. That&apos;s one of the problems of cold, dry text on the Internet without any accompanying extra-verbal clues such as tone of voice. I guess I should have been a little more careful with my tone.</p>\n<p>Another thing that people may not realize is that I was a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WP\">WP</a> user for quite some time (from back around the 1.5 days up to but not including 2.1.3) and I did enjoy using it; it was just that the security thing started to exasperate me to the point where I decide to let it go. I actually switched to WP initially, like many others, because of the commercialization of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/MT\">MT</a>. But when I set up the weblog for wincent.com I decided to use MT because it seemed technically superior for mission-critical applications whereas WP still seemed the best for personal or hobbyist use (and I continued to use it on personal projects).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;He&apos;s also ignored the way you guys handle crises like security issues. You&apos;re generally open, honest and totally trustworthy.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This misses the entire point of my post, which is <em>all about</em> the handling of security issues. I&apos;ve now explained this multiple times (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/04/wordpress_213_b.php\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/06/wordpress_flaw.php\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/06/wordpress_follo.php\">here</a>).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;I have tried MT and blogger before, but I simply find Wordpress easier to control and maintain.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yes, no arguments there. The WP upgrade process is much easier, especially when using <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion\">Subversion</a> (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Upgrading_WordPress_using_Subversion\">info</a>). The MT upgrade process is considerably more painful (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Upgrading_from_Movable_Type_version_3.34_to_3.35\">example</a>). But MT&apos;s technical advantages (the ability to produce a totally static weblog) in my specific usage context make it the choice for me, despite its other problems.</p>\n<a name=\"Totally%20mistaken\"></a><h3>Totally mistaken</h3>\n\n<p>Related to the category of &quot;misunderstandings&quot; is the category of &quot;totally mistaken&quot;. These are comments by people who didn&apos;t misread my argument but instead inferred something completely unrelated, mistaken and in no way connected with the content of my post.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;Uh-oh, I smell a publicity whore...&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;there&apos;s always going to be a few people that take an unpopular position to get a little attention&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;he obviously thinks far higher of his reputation and himself than he ought&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;People like that will take potshots at WP, and you all out of some desperate hope to gain some traction.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;Who wants to bet Wincent still uses IE6?&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Well, I&apos;m a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mac%20OS%20X\">Mac OS X</a> user, so no, I&apos;m not &quot;still using IE6&quot;, although my personal browser selection has little to do with the unrelated topic of web application security.</p>\n<p>Many of these comments speculate about me trying to get attention through my post but that certainly wasn&apos;t my goal. I had no idea that Michael Tsai would pick up my article, and that from there it would reach Daring Fireball, and from there elicit a response from Matt. This was just me posting my opinions to my humble little weblog with its small readership. If I was still a WordPress user I would&apos;ve had different goals and would&apos;ve chosen different channels in an effort to get the WP team to tighten up their processes; but I am not a WP user and I merely wanted to spend five minutes penning a quick expression of my disappointment (&quot;look, I decided to drop WordPress a while back and looks like things are continuing as they were before&quot;).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;It&apos;s unfortunate that their ill researched and poorly written post has had the attention it has&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I don&apos;t know if an opinion can be &quot;ill researched&quot;. All of the information about WordPress security track record is out in the open and I provide links to it where appropriate. I draw my own conclusions from that track record. I don&apos;t think this qualifies as &quot;ill research&quot;. And &quot;poorly written&quot;? I think the only reason my post got the attention it did, given that I am a total &quot;nobody&quot; in the WP-o-sphere, is that it was evidently well-written. You may not agree with my opinions, but the argument is reasonably well expressed.</p>\n<a name=\"About%20comments%20being%20disabled\"></a><h3>About comments being disabled</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;The fact that they hide behind an excuse like disabling comments &apos;for security&apos; underscores the fact that they are not only cowards&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;what&apos;s the point of a blogging system that&apos;s only secure if you disable comments?&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;who&apos;d need stupid things like comments on a blog?&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;And blog with disabled comments?&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;It&#x2019;s also interesting to note that a similar WP-hating blogger linked from Wincent&#x2019;s (<a href=\"http://fukamachi.org/wp/2007/06/21/yet-another-wordpress-exploit/\">http://fukamachi.org/wp/2007/06/21/yet-another-wordpress-exploit/</a>) has seen fit to disable comments on that particular point after a couple of comments dismantling his post. I can understand disliking WP, but squashing any opposing opinions? Very mature.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&apos;s worth clarifying here that comments were not specifically disabled for my post; comments have never been enabled on my weblog. Likewise, comments were not disabled &quot;in order to make MT more secure&quot;; rather, I chose to not enable comments for the reasons already mentioned at the start of this post and the added security is just a secondary benefit.</p>\n<a name=\"On%20the%20logo\"></a><h3>On the logo</h3>\n\n<blockquote>One more thing and then I&apos;ll shut up. Is it me or does Wincent&apos;s logo look an awful lot like WordPress&apos;s?</blockquote>\n<p>Ironic but not surprising given the number of organizations out there whose names start with &quot;W&quot; and who have chosen logos which are variants on the &quot;W inside a circle&quot; theme. Out of curiosity I thought I&apos;d look and see which logo predates the other.</p>\n<p>The earliest appearance of the WordPress logo that I could find in <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://wordpress.org\">the archives</a> was back on <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20051227053045/http://www.wordpress.org/\">27 December 2005</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking back in <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://wincent.com\">the archives</a> for the Wincent logo the earliest appearance I could find was back on <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030927071700/http://www.wincent.com/\">27 September 2003</a>.</p>\n<a name=\"Rational%20responses\"></a><h3>Rational responses</h3>\n\n<p>Unfortunately there were far too few of these. Matt&apos;s own response was one of them. Here&apos;s another example from the visitor comments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;Frankly I see both sides of this story. I thought that Wincent&#x2019;s points were actually quite valid, though his conclusion seemed harsh. And as a new user of Wordpress, I found them of concern. Your response also had merit.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"On%20table%20based%20layout\"></a><h3>On table based layout</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;His table-layout blog isn&apos;t too notable&quot; (Matt)</li>\n<li>&quot;was the jab about his table-based design really necessary?&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;I loved the barely concealed &apos;table-layout blog&apos; at the start of your post.&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;I can&apos;t take anything seriously from someone who still uses tables as their primary layout method.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When people try to undermine my credibility because of my old-school layout, I think they only make their own argument look weaker. Why spend time looking at my HTML source trying to find extraneous details which can be used to disparage me? Why not just address my textual arguments, seeing as they&apos;re the only thing that matters?</p>\n<p>If people knew me better then they wouldn&apos;t hold it against me for using a table-based layout in 2007. I&apos;m not somebody who chose tables out of ignorance, rather I am an informed, technical user who made the decision (back in 2004 when the site was designed) for a number of reasons: namely, I wanted an extremely clean and simple design, I wanted maximum compatibility with legacy browsers, due to time constraints and a lack of artistic ability I didn&apos;t start with a clean state but instead modified one of the default templates, and I had no plans or need to pursue maximal separation of  layout/presentation from content at that point.</p>\n<p>Things change, newer browsers gain market share, CSS support improves, and of course the sites that I have worked on since then haven&apos;t used tables for layout. But &quot;if it ain&apos;t broke, don&apos;t fix it&quot;; the table based layout is not going to go away until some point in the future in which the site is totally redesigned. In the meantime, it has no relevance whatsoever to the validity of the content I post there.</p>\n<a name=\"Parting%20words\"></a><h3>Parting words</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;With MT4 poised for release, you can prolly expect more of this kind of mudslinging.&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This again quite misses the point: I&apos;m no <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/MT%20fanboy\">MT fanboy</a>, rather I am someone who has used both <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/MT\">MT</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WP\">WP</a> and is disappointed with the approach to security taken by the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WP\">WP</a> team. I recommend <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/MT\">MT</a> for those for whom security is important, and I specifically abstain from recommending <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WP\">WP</a> to non-technical users who are unlikely to have the expertise to upgrade or realize the importance of doing so.</p>\n<p>I personally am looking forward to the day when I am neither an <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/MT\">MT</a> nor a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/WP\">WP</a> user. I am tired of running so many third party applications (forums, bug trackers, mailing lists, weblogs, wikis etc) and having to be constantly updating them, not to get features (that would be optional) but to patch security holes (not optional). For some time now I have been dedicating some of my spare time to learning <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Rails\">Rails</a> so that I can eventually replace <em>all</em> of the third-party stuff I use with a single in-house solution; not a Swiss Army Knife of web applications that does everything all the other apps do, but an extremely simple, tailored solution that does exactly what I need and <em>nothing</em> more. Then my third-party security concerns will be focussed on a single point of possible failure (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Rails\">Rails</a> itself), and of course, my own code.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>I&apos;m a big fan of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/unit%20testing\">unit testing</a>, and every now and again something happens which confirms my preference.</p>\n<p>At the moment I am working on a transformer that uses a third-party library and that library expects <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/UCS-2\">UCS-2</a> input (ugh). So I take my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/UTF-8\">UTF-8</a> input, convert it to UCS-2, and as I get bits of text back from the library I transform them back into UTF-8.</p>\n<p>My code is about 1,200 lines of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/C\">C</a> and I have almost 900 lines of unit tests written in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby\">Ruby</a> so far. The coverage is reasonable at this stage, although I continue to add more and more input variants to the tests.</p>\n<p>This morning I decided to take the slightly more efficient approach of minimizing my encoding conversions by doing all operations internally in UCS-2 and performing a once-off conversion on receiving the input text, and another on returning the final output text.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the extensive unit tests I was able to make invasive, far-reaching changes throughout the entire source file, effectively ripping out the textual spine of the old version and replacing it with a new version. It was one of those changes that had to be done all at once &#x2014; incremental conversion was not possible &#x2014; and the code would be unrunnable while the conversion was in process. Some of the changes involved &quot;blind&quot; <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/regular%20expression\">regular expression</a>-based global find-and-replace operations.</p>\n<p>After doing all this I was able to run the unit tests, caught one small error (easily corrected with another mass find-and-replace), and then fire off the tests again to find that everything was working again. This kind of thing would be totally painful without unit tests, but with them it is a breeze. You make edits quicker and with more confidence (fearlessly I would say, especially with the safety net of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/version%20control\">version control</a> providing you with a quick way of reviewing changes and backing them out if necessary). And you emerge at the end of it confident that you haven&apos;t changed the behaviour of your code in any way (other than making it faster, as profiling shows).</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002277more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>In working on my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/wikitext\">wikitext</a>-to-HTML transformer I saved the ugliest bit for last: parsing/transforming nested lists. I started off with parsing simple span-level elements like <tt>em</tt> and <tt>strong</tt> tags, then moved on to block level items like paragraphs and <tt>pre</tt> blocks, and nesting containers like <tt>blockquote</tt> blocks. But I had to keep putting off lists.</p>\n<p>Given input like the following (using the same syntax as that used by <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/MediaWiki\">MediaWiki</a>):</p>\n<pre># this is an ordered list\n# which continues\n## and has another ordered list\n## nested inside it\n# and then falls back\n#* and then nests another list\n#* this time an unordered one\n#** itself containing a nested list\n#** which continues\n#**# and finally nests yet another ordered list\n#**# which continues\n#* drops back quite a way\n# and finally all the way\n#****** and finishes with an invalid item</pre>\n<p>We want a corresponding nested list described in valid <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/HTML\">HTML</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002278more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>As this is wikitext, we want to handle the last item (the invalid) one gracefully. It mustn&apos;t  break the validity of the HTML but we don&apos;t want a silent failure either. We don&apos;t want to increase the nesting level several times in one go (probably not what the author intended); it really only makes sense to increase the nesting-level once per line. So the solution will be to handle it the same way Wikipedia does and consider the first <tt>*</tt> to mark the beginning of a nested list and subsequent (invalid) <tt>*</tt> to belong to the first item of that list; this is important because it means they will be displayed back to the user and hopefully alert him/her of the error.</p>\n<p>Looking at this HTML makes my brain hurt, but this is what we want to produce:</p>\n<pre>&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;this is an ordered list&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;which continues\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;and has another ordered list&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;nested inside it&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;and then falls back\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;and then nests another list&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;this time an unordered one\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;itself containing a nested list&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;which continues\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;and finally nests yet another ordered list&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;which continues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;drops back quite a way&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;and finally all the way\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;***** and finishes with an invalid item&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;</pre>\n<p>When rendered this will look like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>this is an ordered list</li>\n<li>which continues<ol>\n<li>and has another ordered list</li>\n<li>nested inside it</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>and then falls back<ul>\n<li>and then nests another list</li>\n<li>this time an unordered one<ul>\n<li>itself containing a nested list</li>\n<li>which continues<ol>\n<li>and finally nests yet another ordered list</li>\n<li>which continues</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>drops back quite a way</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>and finally all the way<ul>\n<li>***** and finishes with an invalid item</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So anyway, it&apos;s done now, in about 130 lines of well-commented <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/C\">C</a> code. Surprisingly, despite the recursive structure of the lists the actual transformation code is entirely iterative and no recursion is involved. I still don&apos;t know if this is the best way to do it but it is what seemed to be the simplest solution. Indenting could be added to make the structure of the source clearer but as this is intended to be (mostly) read by machines and not humans it doesn&apos;t seem like its worth the trade-offs in complexity and speed.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>So lately the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/\">Subversion log</a> has been quiet, because I&apos;ve been doing a lot of development work in a private (local-only) <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK\">SVK</a> sandbox. This is great for trying things out but it also means that regular progress updates aren&apos;t instantly available to customers.</p>\n<p>So last night I stopped working in the sandbox and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2007/07/wocommon_r633_13_items_changed.php\">imported the results</a> back into the main repository, which means that subsequent changes (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2007/07/wocommon_r634_1_item_changed.php\">starting here</a>) will be visible to the public eye.</p>\n<p>This temporary lack of communication bothers me, and the lack of remote backup also bothers me: when the repository is on a remote machine you automatically get some redundancy (remote repository, local <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK\">SVK</a> mirror, local <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK\">SVK</a> working copy, or copies); but when you work on a  local-only branch your only redundancy comes from your daily backups to DVD-R.</p>\n<p>So far I&apos;ve been <em>very</em> impressed with <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK\">SVK</a>&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/branching\">branching</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/merging\">merging</a> but I am also worried that it might not be entirely bullet-proof. I haven&apos;t been bitten yet, but I occasionally see reports on the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/svk-devel\">svk-devel</a> mailing list about wedged repositories and merge bugs and that worries me.</p>\n<p>Also, it&apos;s quite slow. <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a>, on the other hand, seems solid as a rock and incredibly fast by all reports. I also couldn&apos;t get <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK\">SVK</a> installed on <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard\">Leopard</a> the last time I tried, thus forcing me to go back to the mergeless world of vanilla <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion\">Subversion</a>; <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK\">SVK</a>, like many other big <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Perl\">Perl</a> applications, sometimes resembles a teetering stack of fragile components with unfathomable interdependencies. <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a> on the other hand is lightweight, portable <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/C\">C</a>. And now that I have multiple branches for the different versions of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mac%20OS%20X\">Mac OS X</a>, reliability and functionality across <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Tiger\">Tiger</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard\">Leopard</a>, as well as robustness of merging is increasingly important.</p>\n<p>So I think the writing is on the wall for <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK\">SVK</a>. It seems inevitable that I&apos;ll move, sooner or later, to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a>. There are still a couple of gaps that would need to be filled in, but 90% of what I need is there. <a href=\"http://utsl.gen.nz/talks/git-svn/intro.html\">This looks to be a nice tutorial</a> for <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion\">Subversion</a> users looking to move to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a>, especially those who are already familiar with distributed <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/version%20control\">version control</a> thanks to their experience with <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK\">SVK</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002287more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

The move from <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Tiger\">Tiger</a> to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard\">Leopard</a> is one such situation because it doesn&apos;t just involve updates to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/API\">API</a> but a change to the language as well (to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Objective-C\">Objective-C</a> 2.0).</p>\n<p>This means that the two branches very quickly diverge because the language changes are pervasive. So when you make a change on one branch and try to merge it back into another you find that it&apos;s not just a case of adding or removing lines, but of having translate them at the same time. It&apos;s kind of like trying to automatically merge changes between the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby\">Ruby</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Python\">Python</a> ports of a project; you can &quot;merge&quot; but you have to rewrite along the way so you may as well just do it manually.</p>\n<p>In my case I don&apos;t intend to keep the two branches in lock-step with each other so <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/cherry%20picking\">cherry picking</a> will be fine.

    "html": "<p>I just stumbled across a fascinating mailing list thread in which there&apos;s a fairly nasty exchange between two open source poster children, Bram Cohen (of BitTorrent fame, but in this case writing in his capacity as Codeville developer) and Linus Torvalds (of Linux fame, original author of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a>).</p>\n<p>Now, I&apos;ve never had a particular liking for either of these personalities, although I&apos;ve had to recognize that they&apos;re very clever individuals. Both of them have been known for occasional demonstrations of arrogance.</p>\n<p>But the really interesting thing about <a href=\"http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au/archives/git/0504/2153.html\">their interchange</a> is not the fireworks in the thread but the way things look like in hindsight. Having become familiar with Git over the last few days I have to say that Torvalds was right on just about every count. I knew Torvalds was smart, but seeing as I was never really more than an occasional Linux user I never realized just how smart; I&apos;d thought he was just a good programmer who happened to be in the right place at the right time and had a few good ideas. But after closely studying Git I&apos;m a little bit awestruck; Torvalds is a frickin&apos; genius, a true visionary, and somehow managed to just &quot;get it&quot; and instantly, in a flash of insight, come up with &quot;the solution&quot; for version control. In the meantime, Codeville still languishes in pre-1.0 &quot;alphaville&quot; and Git has forged ahead to become (at version 1.5.2.4) the most powerful, high-performance, superbly documented version control system out there and with a stunningly active community.</p>\n<blockquote>Git is a weekend hack which looks like a weekend hack.</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://bramcohen.livejournal.com/17319.html\">Bram Cohen</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002396more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<a name=\"On%20merge%20algorithms\"></a><h3>On merge algorithms</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.codeville.org/\">Codeville website</a> has this to say:</p>\n<blockquote>If you&apos;d like to know why there is a need for new merge algorithms, consider what the lead monotone developer has to say.</blockquote>\n<p>And clicking through <a href=\"http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.monotone.devel/3264\">the link</a> reveals that this is what he has to say:</p>\n<blockquote>3-way merge is an inappropriate choice of merge algorithm for a modern VCS.</blockquote>\n<p>He describes a scenario in which the merge algorithm doesn&apos;t produce desirable results. Once you understand the scenario you can scan <a href=\"http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au/archives/git/0504/2153.html\">the mailing list thread</a> where Bram and Linus duke it out; selected highlights:</p>\n<blockquote><strong>Bram:</strong> Honestly, that you would think of doing whole-tree three-way merges and even consider moving lines between files shows that you haven&apos;t explored the merge problem very deeply. This is a much harder problem than you think it is, and one which has already been solved by other systems.\n<p>What I&apos;d really like to hear is some explanation of why git is reimplementing all of this stuff from scratch. Your implicit claims that git will do more things than the other systems without having to reinvent all of their functionality first are, honestly, naive, ill-informed arrogance.</p>\n<p>I&apos;d like to reiterate that *nothing* out there supports moving lines between files, and further predict, with total confidence, that if git tries to support such functionality it will simply fail, either by giving up or creating a system which can behave horribly. Before you get all dismissive about this claim, please remember that I&apos;ve spent years thinking about merge algorithms, and have actually designed and implemented them, and have spoken at length with other people who have done the same, while you&apos;ve merely thought about them for a few weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Linus:</strong> Me _personally_, I want to have something that is very repeatable and non-clever. Something I understand _or_ tells me that it can&apos;t do it. And quite frankly, merging single-file history _without_ taking all the other files&apos; history into account makes me go &quot;ugh&quot;.</p>\n<p>The important part of a merge is not how it handles conflicts (which need to be verified by a human anyway if they are at all interesting), but that it should meld the history together right so that you have a new solid base for future merges.</p>\n<p>In other words, the important part is the _trivial_ part: the naming of the parents, and keeping track of their relationship. Not the clashes.</p>\n<p>And it looks like 99% of SCM people seem to think that the solution to that is to be more clever about content merges. Which misses the point entirely.</p>\n<strong>Bram:</strong> So you think that a system which supports snapshots and history but has no merging functionality whatsoever is the right thing? I&apos;m asking this seriously.</blockquote>\n<p>I&apos;m not sure how many merge algorithms <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a> has at the time that thread took place, but today it has four (see the <tt>git-merge</tt> man page for details). But clever or non-clever merge algorithms are besides the point: what were the real insights that Torvalds somehow grasped from the very beginning? What is it that made me describe him above as &quot;a frickin&apos; genius&quot;?</p>\n<a name=\"What%20Git%20does%20right\"></a><h3>What Git does right</h3>\n\n<p>There is no need for fancy metadata, rename tracking and so forth. The only thing you need to store is the state of the tree before and after each change. What files were renamed? Which ones were copied? Which ones were deleted? What lines were added? Which ones were removed? Which lines had changes made inside them? Which slabs of text were copied from one file to another? You shouldn&apos;t have to care about any of these questions and you certainly shouldn&apos;t have to keep special tracking data in order to help you answer them: all the changes to the tree (additions, deletes, renames, edits etc) are implicitly encoded in the delta between the two states of the tree; you just track what is the content.</p>\n<p>Git is already very smart, and it can (and will) get smarter about figuring out what happened, and where a given line in a given revision came from, and it will do so without ever having to embed additional meta data in its repositories. Absolutely everything can (and should) be inferred.</p>\n<p>Git breaks the mould because it thinks about content, not files. It doesn&apos;t track renames, it tracks content. And it does so at a whole-tree level. This is a radical departure from most version control systems. It doesn&apos;t bother trying to store per-file histories; it instead stores the history at the tree level. When you perform a diff you are comparing two trees, not two files.</p>\n<p>As a result of this fundamental design decision, the structure of a Git repository is stunningly simple. It&apos;s so simple in fact, that you&apos;ll be surprised at the sophistication of the things you can do with it. But that&apos;s the way the best code will always be: simple, solid premises out of which complex applications arise.</p>\n<p>The other fundamentally smart design decision is how Git does merges. The merging algorithms <em>are</em> smart but they don&apos;t try to be <em>too</em> smart. Unambiguous decisions are made automatically, but when there&apos;s doubt it&apos;s up to the user to decide. This is the way it should be. You don&apos;t want a machine making those decisions for you. You never will want it. That&apos;s the fundamental insight in the Git approach to merging: while every other version control system is trying to get smarter, Git is happily self-described as the &quot;stupid content manager&quot;, and it&apos;s better for it.</p>\n<a name=\"Footnote\"></a><h3>Footnote</h3>\n\n<p>If you try the tricky merge issue described by the Monotone dev <a href=\"http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.monotone.devel/3264\">above</a> you&apos;ll find that <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a> does exactly the right thing:</p>\n<pre>mkdir playground\ncd playground\ngit init\necho &quot;hello, world&quot; &gt; greeting\ngit add greeting \ngit commit -m &quot;Add greeting&quot;\ngit checkout -b left\ngit mv greeting saludo\ngit commit -a\ngit checkout master\ngit rm greeting\ngit commit -a\ngit merge left</pre>\n<p>Git responds with:</p>\n<pre>CONFLICT (rename/delete): Renamed greeting-&gt;saludo in left and deleted in HEAD\nAutomatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</pre>\n<p>In my opinion this is exactly the right behaviour. This is a clearly ambiguous merge and it simply wouldn&apos;t be right for your version control system to try &quot;resolving&quot; it for you. You actually want it to be a &quot;dumb&quot; content tracker and handle automatically only the simplest, non-ambiguous cases; in an instance like this one you <em>want</em> it to ask you what to do. And as you can see, Git does an excellent job of describing the nature of the conflict, which will make it easier for you to solve it.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

It had not occurred to me that CVS and Subversion were fundamentally broken. Torvalds is undeniably a smart guy, but he&apos;s also known for his bluster. I&apos;d heard Git mentioned a few times before, usually in the context of it being difficult to use, something only a kernel developer could love. So I was skeptical but interested enough to try it out.\nWhat I found is that Torvalds&apos;s bragging is justified. Learning about Git after using other version control systems is somewhat like learning a new programming language that&apos;s radically different from what you&apos;ve known before. Even if you might not need the more unusual features most of the time, you feel as though your eyes have been opened, your mind expanded.</blockquote>\n<p>Sounds like Michael followed a similar trajectory to mine, <a href=\"http://mjtsai.com/blog/2004/08/30/cvs2svn/\">migrating</a> from <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/CVS\">CVS</a> to Subversion a few years ago (a &quot;no brainer&quot; at the time), and now to Git. Since 2004, distributed version control has gotten big and soon enough moving to that will be a &quot;no brainer&quot; too.</p>\n<p>Along the way, I took a detour via <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK\">SVK</a> and I am still using it in fact, but I want to migrate everything to Git eventually. SVK is an awesome system, but it&apos;s fragile, complex and slow compared to Git, and because it is just a layer over the top of existing (Subversion) infrastructure it must carry with it the baggage and the ideas that go with it. Git on the other hand, wipes the slate clean and starts from scratch with some basic ideas which are at once stunningly simple and revolutionary. It&apos;s hard not to use that kind of language when you talk about Git.</p>\n<p>As I noted yesterday, the most fundamental and important of these ideas is that metadata is an unnecessary distraction. You don&apos;t need to track renames or merges anything else. Subversion makes this mistake (tracking renames) and SVK does too (tracking merges), even though it&apos;s distributed and could be &quot;smarter&quot;. Git, on the other hand, explicitly tracks nothing and absolutely everything is inferred from the changes in state of the tree. That&apos;s the only thing that matters. As Michael notes, the structural design of the repository itself is <em>beautifully</em> clean; and that&apos;s why Git doesn&apos;t need to pack metadata into tags in order to remember when merges and copies took place (like SVK does): the parent (or parents) of every commit is clearly recorded and everything else is implicitly encoded by the structure (the <a href=\"http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/\">Directed Acyclic Graph</a>) of the history. This in turn leads to a clean, understandable codebase whose simplicity inspires confidence.</p>\n<p>I get the impression that I&apos;ve probably followed <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a> a little more closely than Michael -- I&apos;ve had a long-running interest in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/version%20control%20systems\">version control systems</a> -- ever since it was first mentioned on <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Slashdot\">Slashdot</a>. I too saw the video that Michael mentions and didn&apos;t really learn anything new (although it was the first time I heard that Git could track the movement of blocks of text from one file to another, and that made me start wondering about Git again). It&apos;s really my dissatisfaction with SVK&apos;s speed that pushed me to start playing with Git, but the deeper I dug the more impressed I was.</p>\n<p>Yes, Git is hard to learn. Yes, you have to read a <em>lot</em> of documentation in order to &quot;get&quot; it. But the good thing is, the documentation <em>is</em> available and it is very, very good. The time you invest in reading it, learning about Git&apos;s underpinnings, and understanding the <em>why</em> of it all, is time well spent. Git has some very smart people working on it, scarily, intimidatingly good programmers, and the mailing list archive is full of helpful material. If you look at carefully, chances are you&apos;ll want to switch to Git too.</p>\n<p>And you&apos;ll see that although Git is hard to <em>learn</em>, it&apos;s dead easy to <em>use</em>. Once you know how it works you can do stuff that you&apos;d never dream of doing with a version control system like Subversion; and you&apos;ll do stuff with confidence that you might hesitate to try with a system like SVK.</p>\n<p>So there are plenty of big changes in the air. <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard\">Leopard</a> is coming. New <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/APIs\">APIs</a> are on the way. <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Objective-C\">Objective-C</a> 2.0 is here. And we could well be on the brink of a sea change in version control. Seems like as good a time as any to make a radical departure.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002397more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

There are still a couple of gaps that would need to be filled in, but 90% of what I need is there.</blockquote>\n<p>Yesterday I talked about <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/07/git_notes.php\">getting up a web interface</a> for my public repositories; I&apos;ve migrated three so far. The <tt>gitweb</tt> interface largely supercedes the existing &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/\">Subversion log</a>&quot; interface, at least for my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/open%20source\">open source</a> projects.</p>\n<p>Today I was able to implement the key infrastructure change necessary to start moving my private repositories to Git too. Due to their nature, I can&apos;t provide access to these repositories via <tt>gitweb</tt>, so I need to hook them into the existing &quot;Subversion log&quot; mechanisms so that people can be informed of changes that are going on in the codebase.</p>\n<p>The first automatic Git-driven update to the log can be seen <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2007/07/initial_import_snippets_4cfa16.php\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002420more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>This is done with a Git <tt>post-receive</tt> hook script that updates the log (actually just a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Movable%20Type\">Movable Type</a> <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/weblog\">weblog</a>) via <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/XML-RPC\">XML-RPC</a>. Doing this is a little bit trickier than it is with <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion\">Subversion</a>.</p>\n<p>Subversion hooks are simple: for each commit your hook script runs exactly once; and because Subversion is a client-server system all of commits occur in real time, meaning you don&apos;t have to worry about the timestamps on your commits (they always just occurred when the hook script runs).</p>\n<p>Git, on the other hand, will run your hook script once for each update to a branch (and for other things too, like branch creation and deletion, tagging and so forth). But if you <tt>push</tt> out a bunch of commits in one go, Git will fire the hook script only once; you then have to build up a revision list using the &quot;plumbing&quot; to take into account things like already-reported commits, and the possibility that your starting and end points might not even be on the same branch. And you don&apos;t get easy-to-read, human-parseable revision numbers like you do in Subversion: you get hardcore cryptographic hashes.</p>\n<p>In the end, the bit of logic that seems to do the job is this one (written in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby\">Ruby</a>):</p>\n<pre>          @list = %x{\n            git rev-parse --not --all |\n            grep -v $(git rev-parse #{ref_name}) |\n            git rev-list --reverse --stdin $(git merge-base #{old_rev} #{new_rev})..#{new_rev}\n          }</pre>\n<p>So this seems to work, but it&apos;s not as straight forward as the Subversion way. On the other hand, there&apos;s a hell of a lot of scope for doing heavily customized stuff; look at the <tt>post-receive-email</tt> example hook script in the Git <tt>contrib</tt> directory. I guess it&apos;s like many things in Git: tricky but powerful.</p>\n<p>I like the look of the new entries because Git encourages (but doesn&apos;t impose) the use of more detailed commit messages with a &quot;subject&quot; line followed by a blank separator line and then a &quot;body&quot;, and it also provides tools for conveniently extracting those parts of the message (see <tt>man git-show</tt>). The only thing I&apos;d like to change is the line wrapping behaviour; I&apos;ve been hard-wrapping the messages so that they look good in the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Terminal\">Terminal</a>, but I&apos;d like for the hard-wrapping to be ignored on the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/web\">web</a>...

    "html": "<p>Hot on the heels of the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/07/involuntary_reb_11.php\">last involuntary reboot</a> we have an absolute whopper today.</p>\n<p>At about 3 PM today my machine started to get suspiciously slow after having been up for only a couple of hours. Within a few minutes it had become completely unresponsive, except for the updating of the clock. Normally if this goes on long enough I end up reluctantly performing a hard reset, but in this case there were still signs of life: namely, every few minutes the machine would show <em>some</em> evidence that it was still alive &quot;down there&quot; and would respond to my instructions, albeit tardily.</p>\n<p>So over the course of the next hour and a half I managed to painfully exit all of my applications. At its worst this entailed a wait of 15 minutes between clicking on a Dock icon and the corresponding menu popping onto the screen. But the idea was to give all of those applications a chance to write out their state to disk; I hate yanking the plug at the best of times, but when apps like Mail are open with their fingers in the mulit-gigabyte pie that is my mail folder I hate it even more.</p>\n<p>At about 4:30 PM I managed to issue the instruction to reboot. The machine took nearly an hour and a half to power down. Would she boot up? Perhaps hoping that she would was too optimistic; at 7:30 PM I finally had to admit that the boot wasn&apos;t likely to finish any time soon, and so I yanked the power: Involuntary Reboot Number 12.</p>\n<p>As always after a hard reset I booted from the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mac%20OS%20X\">Mac OS X</a> install disc and ran Disk First Aid on the volume. The startup volume reported irrecoverable errors; I attempted the repair four times, just to be sure. Time to bite the bullet and restore from my daily backup (on the external FireWire volume); for some reason Disk Utility wouldn&apos;t me drag any volumes at all: I could click on them but I couldn&apos;t drag them, so restoring was impossible.</p>\n<p>So I tried booting from the cloned backup volume. It took a good while, most likely freaking out trying to access my now fried ex-startup volume. I fired up Disk Utility again and after using it to confirm the &quot;hosed&quot; diagnosis that I&apos;d previously obtained, I noted that this time it did allow me to drag, but the restore was so ridiculously slow that I had to abort it (at well under 500 kilobytes per second my 150 GB startup volume would take rather a long time to restore).</p>\n<p>I wiped the volume and fired up SuperDuper! It&apos;s 9:15 PM here now and it&apos;s currently copying the contents of the backup back over to the original startup disk. There is still a considerable amount of copying to be done before this is all over, and my faith in the integrity of that startup volume is now somewhat shaken.</p>\n<p>I seem to have very bad luck with hard disks, despite my myriad precautions. This reminds me all too much of my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/05/involuntary_reb_1.php\">painful experiences</a> with HFS+ &quot;RAID&quot; back in 2005 (which actually lead me to sell that machine, I just got too sick of wasting literally days battling against data loss).</p>\n<p>So I&apos;ll be watching this disk very carefully over the next few days and possibly increasing the frequency of my backups (I already do a once-per-day mirror of my startup volume to an external disk, as well as a daily burn of my entire home folder to DVD). I&apos;ll also be committing my work even more frequently to my remote repositories.</p>\n<a name=\"Involuntary%20reboot%20stats%20to%20date\"></a><h3>Involuntary reboot stats to date</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Operating system version:</strong> 10.4.10</li>\n<li><strong>Kernel panics:</strong> 6</li>\n<li><strong>Hard resets:</strong> 6</li>\n<li><strong>Total failures:</strong> 12</li>\n<li><strong>Start of recording keeping:</strong> 21 May 2006</li>\n<li><strong>Total days to date:</strong> 425 days</li>\n<li><strong>Average time between failures:</strong> 35 days</li>\n<li><strong>Uptime at moment of failure(s):</strong> less than 2 hours</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002458more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>The barometer is on the move and it indicates a groundswell of interest in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a>. At first I wondered if this was just because <em>I</em> have become interested in Git lately (here&apos;s my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/07/git_hooks.php\">most recent post</a>) and so have been on the lookout for more Git-related content. Then I realized that this isn&apos;t just me looking for confirmation; the confirmation is actually coming knocking on my door with various people who are in my feeds list writing about Git.</p>\n<p>These aren&apos;t &quot;version control people&quot;, they&apos;re Mac programmers just like me. A few days ago there was <a href=\"http://mjtsai.com/blog/2007/07/15/subversion-to-git/\">Michael Tsai</a>, then today I noticed these posts from <a href=\"http://speirs.org/2007/07/19/a-subversion-user-looks-at-git/\">Fraser Speirs</a> and <a href=\"http://www.friday.com/bbum/2007/07/19/git-will-eat-subversions-lunch/\">Bill Bumgarner</a>.</p>\n<p>My gut feeling is that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8\">Linus Torvalds&apos; git talk</a> showing up on YouTube has been a large factor in the recent build-up (currently shows about 87,000 views). (Ugh, the thought that YouTube could change <em>anybody&apos;s</em> life makes me feel distinctly uncomfortable...)</p>\n<p>But whatever the reason, it&apos;s good to see it.</p>\n<a name=\"Fraser\" s%20take'=\"\"></a><h2>Fraser&apos;s take</h2>\n\n<p>Fraser seems to have spent the time digging into <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a> so as to gain an appreciation for its architecture.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The index: Fraser seems to &quot;get&quot; the index but I would add that I think the key concept here is that the index is not a cache, it&apos;s a <em>staging area</em>. When you start thinking about it in those terms you start to see its possibilities rather than worrying about the inconvenience of the &quot;additional step&quot;.</li>\n<li>Merging nibs: Good points on that; I haven&apos;t done a merge involving nibs yet, so I&apos;ll have to reserve judgement on that.</li>\n<li>Externals: I&apos;ve come to realize that this is a non-problem thanks to the fact that I had to face this issue and workaround it with <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK\">SVK</a>; and in doing so I realized that a combination of separate checkouts and symbolic links is conceptually and architecturally much cleaner than Subversion externals anyway: the only downside is that your &quot;externals&quot; don&apos;t hitch along for the ride automatically, you have to remember to update/commit them. Fraser&apos;s hypothesized solution is an interesting one.</li>\n<li>Repository layout: spot on, the <tt>.svn</tt> directories littered throughout a Subversion checkout are a hideous mess; &quot;litter&quot; is the operative word.</li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"Bill\" s%20take'=\"\"></a><h2>Bill&apos;s take</h2>\n\n<p>Bill&apos;s take is much simpler and focusses on one issue: Git is easy to use because it doesn&apos;t make simple things hard in the way that Subversion does; he specifically focusses on Subversion&apos;s long standing problems with opaque collections.</p>\n<blockquote>Subversion needs to focus on the user experience and not just on being a better CVS. There be innovation goin&apos; on and hiding behind &quot;a better CVS&quot; will only work for not terribly much longer.</blockquote>\n<p>Fitz, one of the key Subversion developers, doesn&apos;t seem to get it:</p>\n<blockquote>Feh. Git has perhaps the worst interface ever for a version control system. If you&apos;d said Mercurial, I&apos;d believe you, but since you said Git, I&apos;m going to assume you&apos;re just trolling.</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, Git has a bewildering array of commands and options, but you only have to learn them once. The basic workflow is dead simple. If I had to sum up this in a single sentence it would be:</p>\n<blockquote>Git is hard to learn but easy to use.</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand:</p>\n<blockquote>Subversion is easy to learn, but makes easy things difficult.</blockquote>\n<p>And when we throw the myriad other benefits that Git has over Subversion, Git becomes pretty darn compelling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An extremely active, competent developer community engaged in real innovation</li>\n<li>A distributed model which can still do the client-server style if that&apos;s what you need; by reference incorporate all the benefits the distributed model brings (redundancy, offline commits, speed of operation, amendable commits etc)</li>\n<li>Amazing branching and merging support; and branches, like tags are not tacked on as an afterthought like they are in Subversion</li>\n<li>An incredibly simple, elegant architecutre</li>\n<li>Working copy (repository) format that is often more compact and always richer than the Subversion equivalent</li>\n<li>A powerful, flexible <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/command%20line\">command line</a> interface which is pleasant to use and blows the doors off Subversion once you&apos;ve taken the trouble to learn it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bill finishes with:</p>\n<blockquote>Personally, I desperately hope Subversion fixes this particular problem. Subversion is really and truly awesome in so many ways and I do not want to have to migrate repository software for at least another decade.</blockquote>\n<p>I agree: Subversion is awesome, in its own way, but it ain&apos;t going anywhere. Git, on the other hand, definitely <em>is</em> going somewhere, and in fact has already gotten so far ahead of Subversion that I can&apos;t imagine Subversion ever catching up. If you doubt this then just look at the treacle-like process they&apos;re making towards merge tracking (and note, at this stage we&apos;re still only talking about <em>tracking</em> merges, not actually doing anything interesting with them). I honestly think that if you jump ship now you won&apos;t regret it.</p>\n<a name=\"Parting%20words\"></a><h3>Parting words</h3>\n\n<p>Once comment that made me laugh:</p>\n<blockquote>Several years I&apos;ve been perched on a wobbly stick that is SVK...</blockquote>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002459more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

Another reminder that <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/ZFS\">ZFS</a> can&apos;t come soon enough; fortunately the lesson that you can&apos;t really entrust your data to an HFS+ volume was much less painful compared to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/05/involuntary_reb_1.php\">last time</a> (where I wasted literally days trying to get out of kernel panic hell, and eventually decided to sell my machine and migrate to the humble iMac).</p>\n<p>I&apos;ve escaped fairly lightly because of my obsessive backup and data integrity practices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Burn a daily backup of your entire home directory to DVD</li>\n<li>Periodically send one of those backups offsite so that you&apos;ll be protected in the event of fire or theft</li>\n<li>Mirror your entire startup volume to an external <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/FireWire\">FireWire</a> disk once per day with <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SuperDuper!\">SuperDuper!</a></li>\n<li>Automount the external volume when starting the backup and automatically unmount it once finished so as to keep the disk offline and out of harm&apos;s way in the event that an operating system bug should start to wreak havoc with your available filesystems</li>\n<li>Store your source code in a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/version%20control%20system\">version control system</a>, and have at least one remote repository that mirrors or serves as a central check-in point for your local changes</li>\n<li>Keep your machine as close to a vanilla install as possible</li>\n<li>Be conservative and patient; if your machine starts to misbehave try to do a preemptive reboot rather than an <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/involuntary_reboot_log/\">involuntary one</a></li>\n<li>If you do have to do a hard reset, always run Disk First Aid to try and catch problems early on</li>\n<li>Get a good <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/UPS\">UPS</a> to protect your machine from power outages</li>\n<li>Leave your machine running all the time if you can rather than turning it off at night (most hard drive failures occur when drives are being powered up from cold)</li>\n<li>Use HFS+ with journalling enabled (even though it&apos;s probably about as much protection as a film of cheap cling wrap)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SuperDuper! really saved the day here, and it only really needs to save your butt <em>once</em> in order to justify its $27.95 price tag. For some reason <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Apple\">Apple</a>&apos;s Disk Utility couldn&apos;t restore from my backup volume when booted from the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mac%20OS%20X\">Mac OS X</a> install disc, and when booted from my clone it was still painfully, impossibly slow. SuperDuper!, on the other hand, maintained a perfect bootable clone of my disk and was then able to perform the reverse operation (copying from the clone back to the original) relatively quickly and without any of the degradation that you would expect from what is now a &quot;second generation&quot; copy. My only complaint with SuperDuper! is the! darn! exclamation! point! at! the! end! of it&apos;s! name!</p>\n<p>But still, I did lose <em>some</em> work. Only a little, but every little bit hurts. This was because at the time my daily backup would normally have run I was booted in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard\">Leopard</a> and so it never took place; I had to restore from a backup copy that was made a little over 24 hours before, instead of only 3 or 4.</p>\n<p>So I&apos;ve decided to crank my backup obsession up yet another notch. I have a spare partition on my external disk; only 22 gig but enough to hold about four compressed copies of my home directory (all the really big stuff, things like music and the like is stored outside of my home directory; the single biggest thing is my <tt>~/Library/Mail/</tt> folder which clocks in at around 6 or 7 gig). So I&apos;ve just whipped together <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/archives/2007/07/add_home_directory_backup_scri.php\">another backup script</a> which will perform an <em>additional</em> 4 complete backups of my home directory each day.</p>\n<p>This is run automatically from a cron job so there&apos;s no risk of forgetting. Errors, if any, will be sent to me by mail. The actual backup is run using <tt>nice -n 20</tt> so doesn&apos;t slow the machine down at all. Now my backups are nicely distributed across time: home directory backups at 9 AM, 3 PM, 9 PM, 3 AM; full startup volume backup at 11:30 AM; home directory backup to DVD every evening; and in progress works pushed out to remote <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a> repositories <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/svn-log/\">many times per day</a>.</p>\n<p>So, this has been an annoyance but it hasn&apos;t really hurt me. Still, looking forward to the day when I can throw a large number of cheap IDE disks into a fileserver, format it with ZFS and store my home directory on it. I&apos;ll still do obsessive backups, but it will be nice to think that a single disk can fail without knocking me out for 24 hours.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002463more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

For example, on my test machine they are &quot;ppc7400&quot; and &quot;i386&quot;. The ARCHS environment variable still only contains &quot;ppc&quot; and &quot;i386&quot;, however, and this mismatch causes lipo to complain.</p>\n\n<p>My initial solution was to iterate through VALID_ARCHS trying them out one by one and building up a list of actually-present architectures, but in the end the simplest solution was to forget about using lipo to split things into thin binaries and just work with Universal binaries at every step; this is possible because it seems that the entire tool chain (atos, strip, GDB with dSYM etc) is now capable of working with Universal Binaries.</p>\n\n<p>Signed-off-by: Wincent Colaiuta &lt;win@wincent.com&gt; </p>",

I did make some notes on making the upgrade as smooth as possible with the aid of things like <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Interarchy\">Interarchy</a>&apos;s &quot;mirror upload&quot; feature (see &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Movable%20Type%20upgrade%20notes\">Movable Type upgrade notes</a>&quot;), but it was never going to be as convenient as a Subversion-based upgrade.</p>\n<p>But Git is a distributed version control system so it offers the possibility of doing some tricks that you just can&apos;t do with Subversion.</p>\n<p>I haven&apos;t tried this out yet, it is untested, but I think that you might be able to use the following workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grab the Movable Type source, extract the archive, and use it to initialize a brand new Git repository.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre>unzip MT-first-version.zip\nmv MT-first-version mt_vendor\ncd mt_vendor\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit</pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Perform your customizations on a separate branch in a separate, cloned repository:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre>cd ..\ngit clone mt_vendor mt_mine\ncd mt_mine\ngit co -b my_custom_install --track</pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Whenever a new release comes out update the repository by extracting the archive, overwriting all the old files (but leaving the <tt>.git</tt> directory intact) and performing a <tt>git commit -a</tt>.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre># switch back to vendor repo\ncd ../mt_vendor\n\n# remove all the files from the previous version\nrm -r *\n\n# extract the new files\nunzip MT-new-version.zip\nmv MT-new-version/* .\nrmdir MT-new-version\nrm MT-new-version.zip\n\n# commit changes\ngit commit -a</pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Now merge the changes into your customized install</li>\n</ul>\n<pre>cd ../mt_mine\ngit pull origin master</pre>\n<p>I&apos;m not sure whether this is better than the download/extract/upload cycle, but merging with Git should be much more straightforward than merging with your <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SFTP\">SFTP</a> client... Of course, it would still be a lot easier if Six Apart offered Subversion, Git or even <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/CVS\">CVS</a> access to a repository containing the public releases.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Over the last year I&apos;ve tried to make my development process more and more <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/s/progress/\">transparent and open</a>, and I plan on continuing that trend.</p>\n<p>But I think that sometimes the zoomed-in view on all the details -- the commit logs, the various feeds, the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion\">Subversion</a> (and now <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a>) source code repositories, the bug reports, the mailing lists, the forums, the nightly builds -- can actually be quite confusing. In this post I hope to give a bird&apos;s eye view of what&apos;s been going on and where I&apos;m headed.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002533more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<a name=\"What%20I\" ve%20been%20up%20to%20lately'=\"\"></a><h3>What I&apos;ve been up to lately</h3>\n\n<a name=\"This%20year\"></a><h4>This year</h4>\n\n<p>Since the start of the year there have been a number of maintenance releases of various products, containing bug fixes, optimizations, and minor feature enhancements. These include <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com\">Synergy</a> 3.1.1b, 3.1.1, 3.1.2b, 3.1.2, 3.1.3b, 3.1.3, 3.1.4b and 3.1.4; <a href=\"http://advance.wincent.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> 0.5b and 0.5.1b; <a href=\"http://hextrapolate.wincent.com\">Hextrapolate</a> 2.0b and 2.0; and <a href=\"http://install.wincent.com/\">Install</a> 1.3.1.</p>\n<p>Apart from these visible releases there have been a few key areas of &quot;behind the scenes&quot; focus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby\">Ruby</a>: I had dabbled with Ruby in the past but this was the first time I took on a real project and really got my teeth sunk into things. The benefits of this apprenticeship have been manifold: I feel like my experience with Ruby has made me a better <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/object-oriented\">object-oriented</a> programmer; I&apos;ve developed tools written in Ruby which help me to work better and faster; the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/RubyCocoa\">RubyCocoa</a> bridge that <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Apple\">Apple</a> will be adding to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard\">Leopard</a> will make <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby\">Ruby</a> much more important in the portfolio of tools available to the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Cocoa\">Cocoa</a> programmer.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://walrus.wincent.com\">Walrus</a>: This is the big Ruby project that I just mentioned,  an object-oriented templating system that itself incorporates a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/packrat\">packrat</a> parser generator. In developing this system I gained not only a highly useful tool with which to improve the documentation for my products, I also learnt a lot about parsers, knowledge which I think has application in many, many aspects of programming.</li>\n<li>Learning <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/RSpec\">RSpec</a>: RSpec is an amazing <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Behaviour-Driven%20Development\">Behaviour-Driven Development</a> framework that I used to guide me through my first baby-steps with Ruby, and it helped me to learn a lot about testing &quot;best practices&quot;. I&apos;d like to improve <a href=\"http://test.wincent.com/\">WOTest</a> (the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Objective-C\">Objective-C</a> testing framework that I wrote) based on some of the excellent features of RSpec; although the truth is that perhaps the RubyCocoa bridge will allow me actually use RSpec directly in my Cocoa development.</li>\n<li>A side project has been re-vamping this website; it&apos;s still in its early stages but the eventual goal is to replace the disparate parts of the site (forums, wiki, mailing lists, bug and feature requests database etc) with one single, simple, unified (and modernized) interface.</li>\n<li>Learning <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Rails\">Rails</a>: Wanting to invest my time efficiently I wanted to leverage my growing Ruby knowledge by doing the new version of the website as a Rails application.</li>\n<li>Learning <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/ANTLR\">ANTLR</a>: ANTLR is a sophisticated recognizer generator (capable of generating lexers, parsers, tree parsers). My first completed ANTLR project is a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/wikitext\">wikitext</a> parser in the form of a Ruby extension written in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/C\">C</a>. This will be used at the core of the new website so it has to be fast. My next project will be replacing the Walrus parser (written in Ruby) with an ultra-fast C version. ANTLR is a highly useful tool to master with myriad applications; Apple still uses it in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mac%20OS%20X\">Mac OS X</a>, or so I understand.</li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"This%20month\"></a><h4>This month</h4>\n\n<p>The most significant project of interest this month has been learning about <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a> and starting my migration to it. I had previously started using <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK\">SVK</a> in order to take advantage of its much superior <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/branching\">branching</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/merging\">merging</a> capabilities but the truth is that it is <em>slow</em> despite the fact that its distributed nature gives it a head start on many operations.</p>\n<p>So I started to explore <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a> and gradually built up the assessment that it was: (a) robust, (b) mature, (c) well-suited to my workflow, (d) well-documented, (e) dead fast, (f) backed by an innovative developer community with a promising future, (g) very easy to use once you&apos;ve learnt the basic patterns.</p>\n<p>Changing <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/version%20control%20systems\">version control systems</a> is a big move but it didn&apos;t take too many days of exploration and experimentation to see that moving to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a> is the right thing and that there is no better moment than right now.</p>\n<p>It <em>is</em> a disruptive change but I <em>am</em> at a natural juncture in my development: Apple is about to release Leopard, and with it comes a whole new language: Objective-C 2.0. My new (Objective-C 2.0) codebase is going to diverge farther and farther from the old code base, so this seems like the perfect moment to wipe the slate clean and make a fresh start.</p>\n<a name=\"Where%20I\" m%20headed'=\"\"></a><h3>Where I&apos;m headed</h3>\n\n<p>From what I&apos;ve written it is already pretty clear where I&apos;m headed: the most significant event on the developer calendar this year will be the release of Leopard in October. Between now and then I am going to be investing an increasingly large portion of my time in working on Leopard-only versions of my applications.</p>\n<p>I plan to continue doing the maintenance releases which will run on <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Tiger\">Tiger</a> (or older in some cases) as well as working on the website update and the new parser for Walrus in my spare time.</p>\n<p>I&apos;d like to get Synergy Advance to 1.0 by the time Leopard comes out, but there is a lot that can happen between now and then so it&apos;s impossible to predict whether that desire will be fulfilled. And after that I have two or three products that have been left on the backburner here for literally years and which I&apos;d like to get out there once Leopard is on the shelves.</p>\n<p>It would be nice to take the wraps off the new website before the end of the year, but before that there is still quite a bit of work to be done and I want to upgrade the server to the latest version of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Red%20Hat%20Enterprise%20Linux\">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a> which require both time and money.</p>\n<p>Finally, I&apos;d like to release more of my code as <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/open%20source\">open source</a> but first need to find a viable business model for it. I don&apos;t know if there is one, but if there is I would love to find it. Why? I <em>like</em> the ideas behind both open source and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/free%20software\">free software</a>, and I think they have the potential to produce superior, more secure code. The only missing piece is how to do this as a small vendor and still make a living.</p>\n<p>As always, any relevant news will be posted here.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Back when I exclusively used <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion\">Subversion</a> as my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/version%20control%20system\">version control system</a> of choice I used the Subversion &quot;revision number&quot; as a basis for my build number. This was possible and desirable because Subversion revision numbers have a number of useful properties: they are uniformly increasing integers, they only increment when there are actual changes to the code base (in other words, merely rebuilding is not enough to increment the numbers), and the centralized client/server model used by Subversion guarantees that those build numbers are guaranteed unique and a definitive indication of the <em>exact</em> version of the source code used to construct a given build.</p>\n<p>Prior to that I&apos;d used some script-based automation to provide a more literal notion of &quot;what is a build&quot;. My build numbers had the format <tt>x.y</tt> where <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> were integers. Debug builds would cause <tt>y</tt> to increment by 1 and Release builds would bump <tt>x</tt> up by 1 and reset <tt>y</tt> to 0. This adequately complied with the notion that build numbers should irreversibly increase with time, but it failed to give any definitive indication of the version of the source code used to construct a build. Also, in long running projects where I did lots of rebuilds the build numbers soon got very high; <a href=\"http://advance.wincent.com/\">Synergy Advance</a>, for example, had a build number of over 1500 by the time I switched the the Subversion-based numbering system.</p>\n<p>So what to do now that I&apos;ve moved to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a>? Git is a distributed version control system and so there is no such thing as a &quot;revision number&quot;. Commits are uniquely identified by their <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SHA-1\">SHA-1</a> hash (or a subset of it), but these aren&apos;t very human-friendly (for example, <tt>7eac8946559b6e5db05084f1dfb8d8aca11d9e98</tt> or, in abbreviated form, <tt>7eac894</tt>). Note also how they don&apos;t visibly encode any notion of forward progress because rather than increasing uniformly they &quot;jump around&quot; with apparent randomness, nor do they visibly encode the date.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002602more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>One thing they <em>do</em> do is uniquely identify the exact version of the code used to produce a build, just like Subversion revision numbers do.</p>\n<p>So what should the &quot;build number&quot; be in a Git-based development cycle? At the moment I see three possible options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the abbreviated SHA-1 identifier for the commit</li>\n<li>Use a concise representation of the build date (for example, the output from <tt>date &quot;+%y-%j&quot;</tt>, which would yield build numbers like <tt>07-211</tt>)</li>\n<li>Use a combination of the two</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&apos;m still not decided on the best way to proceed. Using a SHA-1 identifier gives us an explicit handle on the exact revision used to make a build but it is meaningless to the human eye; it only makes sense with access to the Git repository (not possible for closed-source projects) and the help of <tt>git show</tt> or <tt>git log</tt>.</p>\n<p>Using the date gives us some degree of human readability but unless we go even further and add hours, minutes and even seconds we are limited to a one-public-build-per-day granularity (probably sufficient for most cases). But adding more digits to the date reduces readability and could make the build numbers too long (the great thing about the Subversion-based build numbers was that there were only 2, 3 or 4 digits long, depending on the project; I never had a project that got into the 5-digit revision range). Another shortcoming of the date is that it doesn&apos;t provide an unambiguous pointer to the exact version of the source code used to make the build; one has to resort to archaeology to extrapolate the actual revision from the date, which is both error prone and possibly inaccurate. For precision I guess I could use seconds since &quot;the Epoch&quot; (<tt>date &quot;+%s&quot;</tt>) but it would produce quite scary build numbers like <tt>1185799138</tt>. Perhaps a format like <tt>&quot;+%y-%j-%H&quot;</tt> (year, day number, hour) would be a workable compromise between precision and brevity.</p>\n<p>Using a combination of the two suffers from length problems. For example, a combination of year/day (the human-readable bit) followed by an abbreviated SHA-1 hash (the computer-readable bit) might look like <tt>07-211, c180b30</tt>, and I think that&apos;s pushing the limits.</p>\n<p>So I&apos;ve yet to decide on this. Will have to think more on it.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Since I switched to this first-gen Intel iMac as my main desktop machine back in May 2006 I&apos;ve had a pretty bad run with hardware reliability.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year I noticed that the integrated iSight camera was no longer working; in fact it didn&apos;t even appear in the list of devices in the system profiler. The difficulty of disassembling the iMac dissuaded me from investing further; either it&apos;s somehow become unplugged inside (which I doubt) or it&apos;s a more fundamental failure requiring replacement. In any case it&apos;s not a common enough complaint for Google to turn up any useful traces.</p>\n<p>The the other day I had my first <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/07/involuntary_reb_12.php\">catastrophic filesystem failure</a> on this machine, requiring a complete format and restore.</p>\n<p>Now both of these faults might be due to the quality of the components provided by third-parties. It&apos;s disappointing if this is true seeing as Apple has a reputation for choosing quality suppliers; too many corners are being cut when the odds of failure just outside the one-year warranty period start to approach 100%. In the case of the filesystem failure it&apos;s too early to know whether it was hardware-induced or caused by a flaw in Mac OS X and/or Apple&apos;s implementation of HFS+; the system and the disk have been behaving fine since I restored things.</p>\n<p>Along the way I&apos;ve had ongoing problems with my &quot;Mighty Mice&quot;; one standard and one cordless. I&apos;ve previously written about the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/05/mighty_mouse_de.php\">design flaws</a> which I think the device suffers from, and my difficulties in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/06/cleaning_the_mi.php\">cleaning the scroll wheel</a>; I think this latter issue is actually a design problem, or a series of them, too: firstly, the design makes it all too easy for dirt and grit to accumulate in places which impede the functioning of the ball; secondly, the design makes cleaning said ball difficult; and thirdly, the design requires that you actually break or damage in some way the device if you want to open it (necessary for cleaning).</p>\n<p>Anyway, my latest hardware issue is with the built-in Superdrive. I burn <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/07/new_backup_regi.php\">daily backups</a> to DVD and with time the success rate on these burns has been going down. Discs are less and less likely to burn, verification succeeds less and less often, and discs won&apos;t mount either. Annoyingly, a few months ago the unit developed the habit of ejecting discs in such a way that instead of waiting in the slot for me to grab them they would roll out completely and land on the desk, or worse, the floor.</p>\n<p>When things got so bad that of a new batch of 10 DVD+RWs that I&apos;d bought, <em>not even one worked</em>, I went out and bought a cleaning kit. First time I&apos;ve ever done that but I had little choice. After using it I was still unable to burn any discs, or mount any of my previous backups; not very useful backups then, are they?</p>\n<p>Finally, today was the last straw: I tried to insert the official Mac OS X install DVD that came with the machine and not even that would mount; it was ejected by the unit (and would&apos;ve hit the floor if I hadn&apos;t caught it; a reflex I have highly developed over the last few months). It&apos;s one thing having flakey burns, but having a machine that can&apos;t be booted from DVD in an emergency is downright scary. The machine&apos;s track record isn&apos;t good enough to make me feel comfortable about not having that capability for even a short while.</p>\n<p>The unit is the infamous Matshita UJ-846 which isn&apos;t flashable to make it regionless. This means that someone like me, born in one region, living in another, is unable to watch half of the DVDs he&apos;s paid for.</p>\n<p>I didn&apos;t bother looking too far afield for replacement units of this kind (none of my usual online retailers carried it) and instead sought an alternative. The best choice looks to be the <a href=\"http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/pna/v3/pg/product/details/0,,2076_310070061_302357597,00.html\">Pioneer DVR-K06</a>. I don&apos;t know whether I&apos;ll be successful in installing this thing; information is scant but hints suggest that Apple does ship this drive in some of their machines (Mac Minis and some laptops, for example) and there are some unconfirmed claims of people sticking them in Intel iMacs. The published dimensions <a href=\"http://www.command-tab.com/2007/01/01/mac-dvd-burner-upgrades/\">seem to match</a>. Apple itself doesn&apos;t seem to consider this to be a &quot;user-serviceable part&quot;; the closest thing I can find is <a href=\"http://www.info.apple.com/usen/cip/pdf/imacg5/033-2492.pdf\">this set of instructions</a> for swapping a drive in a G5 iMac.</p>\n<p>So I&apos;ve ordered one for $78 and will see if I can get this thing in the Intel iMac. I didn&apos;t want to go for an external FireWire burner (none readily available in the stores here in Spain, it&apos;s USB 2.0 all the way) and in any case the beauty of an internal unit is that it&apos;s automatically protected by the UPS that protects the computer. Besides, having an external enclosures detracts from the all-in-oneness of the iMac (one of its key charms in my opinion); and who wants to sell an iMac with a non-functional camera <em>and</em> dead optical drive?</p>\n<p>I didn&apos;t want to send the machine in to Apple service either; it&apos;s out of warranty (last time I stick with the standard 1 year warranty; I&apos;ve been bitten too many times now!) and I can&apos;t afford to have my one and only work machine away for repairs.</p>\n<p>So I expect the drive will get here in a week or so. I&apos;ll post a report once I&apos;ve found out with this little project will fly.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002606more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Today is not a good day as far as this computer is concerned.</p>\n<p>About an hour ago I left the computer running while I was in the shower. On returning I found the screen blank, the light off and no noise coming from inside the enclosure. Moving the mouse, clicking buttons and pressing keys had no effect. The power had not gone off: the UPS was up with a green light and other peripherals in the same room all had power.</p>\n<p>I immediately checked the power cable running into the back of the machine. Sizzling sounds and the UPS beeps in protest. The power socket feels all too wonky considering the immaculate care I take with this machinery. So I reseat the plug as securely as possible and turn on the machine.</p>\n<p>As I noted in my post, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/08/imac_reliabilit.php\">iMac reliability woes</a>&quot;, the machine doesn&apos;t have a working optical drive at the moment, so I couldn&apos;t follow my usual involuntary reboot procedure and run Disk First Aid after booting off the Mac OS X install disc. Of course, HFS+ is a joke filesystem anyway and I&apos;ve had <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/07/involuntary_reb_12.php\">hideous</a> <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2006/05/involuntary_reb_1.php\">experiences</a> with it in the past, so running Disk First Aid is a bit like replacing blown fuses on the Titanic, but even so it&apos;s something I like to do as part of my &quot;defense in depth&quot; data integrity plan.</p>\n<p>Well, the fun didn&apos;t end with my first involuntary reboot of the day. Number #13 followed suit 2 minutes later when I fell off my chair (what a day) and <em>lightly</em> knocked the keyboard tray. Boom, as Steve Jobs would say. The lights are out again. To add insult to injury at that very moment a bunch of ball bearings spring from the rollers and bounce across the floor. This desk is on its last legs too, it would seem.</p>\n<p>So this time I rip out the power cable and use a substitute. More sizzling noises, but the plug seems well seated.</p>\n<p>Not much more I can do about this now. This machine is of critical importance to me &#x2014; it&apos;s my sole production machine which I use to make a living &#x2014; and so I don&apos;t really want to send it in for maintenance right now; too much work to do and I can&apos;t live without the machine.</p>\n<p>So what I really want to do is get a new machine. I had wanted to save up for a nice beefy Mac Pro and purchase it some time after Leopard comes out (I don&apos;t really want an 8-core machine before then due to technical reasons; the main app that I run which would benefit from 8 cores is Xcode, but problems with Tiger can actually make it run slower with 8 cores than with 4). But I am beginning to wonder whether this machine will survive that long. I can&apos;t afford a Mac Pro right now, so if this thing keels over I might have to hand over the credit card and get another iMac to replace this one. Ouch. I prefer to live debt-free.</p>\n<p>This machine really is showing signs of its age (a whopping 18 months, more or less)... isn&apos;t it possible to buy decent quality components any more? I know that Apple tries to use quality materials and good brands, but it seems that the entire market is engaged in a race-to-the-bottom to see who can churn out the cheapest, nastiest trash possible in the name of making a quick buck and forgetting about things like quality of user experience.</p>\n<p>Remember the days of the Commodore 64? They were built like bricks. I think I was 9 or 10 when we got one in our family and I subjected it to years of abuse (literally, <em>abuse</em>, I even took to it with a soldering iron). Then came the Amiga and again years of use without a single hardware problem. Likewise with my first &quot;PC&quot;, a 486SX-33; never skipped a beat. My first Mac was a PowerMac 7600 and it seems that it was the last reliable machine I ever owned, and even in that case the 1GB hard drive that it came with started to make scraping noises after a couple of years.</p>\n<p>Since then it&apos;s been nothing but trouble: a G3 PowerBook that needed the power socket&apos;s circuit board <em>and</em> its motherboard replaced; an IBM rackmount server that had repeated disk problems; my G5 which again was plagued with disk issues; and now this iMac which seems the worst of the lot. I guess an honorable mention needs to go to my PowerBook G4 which I purchased in the middle of this era of woe: it&apos;s run for years now without any problems.</p>\n<p>On an up note, the tracking info for my order suggests that my Pioneer DVR-K06 has arrived in Spain. With any luck I&apos;ll get it on Monday. Not being able to backup to DVD is a worrisome shortcoming with a machine as unreliable as this one, so I&apos;m keen to get the new burner installed.</p>\n<a name=\"Involuntary%20reboot%20stats%20to%20date\"></a><h3>Involuntary reboot stats to date</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Operating system version:</strong> 10.4.10</li>\n<li><strong>Kernel panics:</strong> 6</li>\n<li><strong>Hard resets:</strong> 8</li>\n<li><strong>Total failures:</strong> 14</li>\n<li><strong>Start of recording keeping:</strong> 21 May 2006</li>\n<li><strong>Total days to date:</strong> 454 days</li>\n<li><strong>Average time between failures:</strong> 32 days</li>\n<li><strong>Uptime at moment of failure(s):</strong> several days, then less than 2 minutes</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002656more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

To get <a href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~woojo/DFFA53A0-F23D-4541-9015-481FD3B6532E/iMac_Disassembly.html\">access to the innards</a> you need to remove a bunch of screws; all but two of them are &quot;torx&quot; screws, which serves as the first &quot;KEEP OUT&quot; sign.</p>\n<p>Titling up and removing the front panel requires you to struggle against metallic plates glued to it, and everything inside is covered by two separate pieces of metallic/plastic sheeting attached with adhesive. Easily removed; impossible to put back exactly the way it was before: there will always be evidence of your trespassing. I guess when they do this in Apple repair centres they either put on new sheeting and brackets, or they have the appropriate adhesives on hand to patch things back up. In my case I guess my iMac will never be the same again as there is a distinct loose feeling in the top right corner now where one of the brackets came off the plastic and I pushed it back on by hand.</p>\n<p>Once inside getting the optical drive out is a royal pain (torx screws even on the inside, and what&apos;s more you need an L-shaped torx screwdriver to do the job easily). Some drops of sweat were shed trying to get the old drive out and then the screws back in place once the new one was in. I was pleased to see that even though it&apos;s not the same brand and model as the original, it was a perfect fit.</p>\n<p>I put everything back together and the drive is recognized by the system profiler and it works. Good. Now I can get back to my daily backups. Also, the new drive doesn&apos;t eject discs onto the floor; it just spits them out far enough for you to grab them when you&apos;re ready.</p>\n<p>All of this didn&apos;t come without a scare. I <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/07/involuntary_reb_12.php\">previously mentioned</a> that the machine&apos;s power socket (or whatever it&apos;s attached to) is at the end of its life. After reassembling the machine it wouldn&apos;t turn on. For a few minutes I feared I&apos;d fried or damaged something inside. Reseating the power cable &quot;fixed&quot; it.</p>\n<p>So will be treating the machine with kid gloves from here on, trying not to touch it and trying not to even bump the desk, and hope that it continues to work until I save up the money for a replacement machine.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002657more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<a name=\"Update\"></a><h3>Update</h3>\n\n<p>I received the following question via email:</p>\n<blockquote>I&apos;m especially interested how you adapted the front panel of your new DVR-K06 because this is not trivial: did you adapt the DVR&apos;s original black panel? Maybe drill two small holes in it and make a notch in it or something else? Or are you using the Apple original panel (from the UJ) &#x2014; I know that the holes on UJ&apos;s body and Apple&apos;s drive mouth brackets aren&apos;t identical with the DVR&apos;s body and the DVR&apos;s drive mouth brackets? How did you do this operation? Maybe photos?</blockquote>\n<p>You&apos;re certainly right that it is not trivial, except perhaps for someone working in a certified repair center with all the right tools and replacement parts. I would have liked to post some photos but my camera is currently on loan and voyaging through Europe.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that all of the external dimensions of the DVR-K06 are identical to those on the UJ-846. This includes both the location of the socket (and the two screws that hold the plug in the socket) as well as the four screws you use to mount the body into the black Apple bracket.</p>\n<p>As for the front plate, I just took off the one that came with the Pioneer, carefully separated the old UJ-846 from the Apple-provided plate (still in the iMac), and inserted the new drive. I had no problems getting the new drive to mesh with the old plate. Perhaps I was just lucky. I don&apos;t see any problems with the slot in the new drive lining up exactly where the old one did.</p>\n<p>I&apos;d also like to flash the drive to use RPC1 (regionless) firmware but that would require me to install Boot Camp and Windows in order to run the flasher, so I guess I&apos;ll just have to use VLC to play DVDs from other regions in the meantime. This is still better than the way things were with the dastardly UJ-846, which was neither flashable nor susceptible to being bypassed via VLC.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p><a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git%201.5.3\">Git 1.5.3</a> just came out a few days ago and one of the greatest things about it is the addition of the <a href=\"http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-stash.html\">git stash</a> command. This addresses one of the most annoying workflow obstacles that I run into many times each day: working on a particular task that may take minutes, hours or even days, and stumbling across something else that could be fixed along the way in a matter of minutes.</p>\n<p>Faced with such a discovery there are four options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make a note reminding yourself about the change and come back to it later</li>\n<li>Make the change anyway, and in your commit message cover both changes (ie. &quot;Did this and also did this&quot;)</li>\n<li>Make the change anyway, and use the <tt>--interactive</tt> switch to <tt>git add</tt> to separately commit hunks from the different changes</li>\n<li>Put your &quot;work in progress&quot; onto a separate temporary branch, switch back to the branch before you started the work, make your change and commit it, then go back to your work in progress branch and continue</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these work to some degree but have their drawbacks. You either wind up with a desk or notebook full of notes, create an unclean history that conflates separate changes and makes it harder to &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/cherry%20pick\">cherry pick</a>&quot;, have to plod through the unwieldy-yet-powerful <tt>git add --interactive</tt> interface, or issue far too many commands for managing and merging branches when what you really want to do is much simpler.</p>\n<p>All of this goes away with <tt>git stash</tt>. Now your workflow looks like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start work-in-progress</li>\n<li>Stash work-in-progress</li>\n<li>Make unrelated change and commit</li>\n<li>Retrieve stash and continue</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And the commands to do so are simple and easy to remember (<tt>git stash</tt>, <tt>git stash apply</tt>, <tt>git stash clear</tt>). As with many other things in Git, it&apos;s quite sophisticated and powerful &#x2014; it&apos;s actually a stack of stashes so you can have multiple things stashed away at once &#x2014; but the basic use case is very straightforward.</p>\n<p>I&apos;ve been looking forward to 1.5.3 for some time now for exactly this reason.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002665more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

So I went to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/08/new_imac_superd.php\">considerable lengths</a> to acquire and install a new drive.</p>\n<p>Well, last night I installed a new Leopard seed after booting off the drive. The machine booted fine and the install disc was visible on the desktop and its contents could be seen in the Finder, but I had to go out.</p>\n<p>On returning, the disc was still visible on the desktop but its contents were no longer anywhere to be seen: &quot;0 items&quot;, claimed the Finder. <tt>ls</tt> in the terminal also returned an empty listing. I ejected the disk and reinserted it but the volume wouldn&apos;t mount. Apple System Profiler claimed that no burner was detected.</p>\n<p>I rebooted into Tiger and same thing: the profile claims there is no burner any more, and the eject key has no effect.</p>\n<p>So I currently have a useless Leopard install (I didn&apos;t have time to install the Xcode Tools before the failure and so can&apos;t do any development work) and a useless Super Drive which worked brilliantly for only two weeks before dying. The Super Drive is now effectively reduced to an expensive, unopenable CD jewell case containing a Leopard seed disc and envolved in wreaths of white plastic and inconveniently-located torx screws.</p>\n<p>Sure, I can get around the roadblock on Leopard development by downloading the latest seed disk image all over again and installing the Xcode Tools from that, but I am still left with the problem of a machine that can no longer boot from DVD in the event of a failure; and failure seems all too likely with such a flakey piece of hardware.</p>\n<p>I really can&apos;t wait to see the tail end of this horrid machine. It&apos;d probably make a better boat anchor than anything else; it&apos;s got the right shape for it.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002666more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>So in my spare time I&apos;ve started learning <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Haskell\">Haskell</a> because I think it&apos;s the right time to learn <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/functional%20programming\">functional programming</a>.</p>\n<p>I started thinking about this almost exactly one year ago when I read <a href=\"http://codemines.blogspot.com/2006/09/another-thread-on-threads.html\">this post</a> by <a href=\"http://codemines.blogspot.com/\">Mark Bessey</a>, a former <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Apple\">Apple</a> employee that used to <a href=\"http://www.friday.com/bbum/2006/09/03/into-the-codemines/\">work with</a> <a href=\"http://www.friday.com/bbum\">Bill Bumgarner</a> on <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Xcode\">Xcode</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>When really massively-parallel systems start to become more common, the programming model will have to change. The simplicity of implementation of the shared-memory model will inevitably give way to more explicitly compartmentalized models. What languages you&apos;ll likely use to program these beasts is an interesting question - most likely, it&apos;ll be a functional language, something like Haskell, or Erlang. I&apos;ve been lax in getting up to speed on functional programming, and I&apos;m going to make an effort to do better. I recommend that you do the same.</blockquote>\n<p>It&apos;s worth reading the <a href=\"http://codemines.blogspot.com/2006/09/another-thread-on-threads.html\">entire article</a>, as well as the <a href=\"http://codemines.blogspot.com/2006/09/hell-is-multi-threaded-c-program.html\">preceding</a> <a href=\"http://codemines.blogspot.com/2006/08/now-they-have-two-problems.html\">parts</a>.</p>\n<p>But my basic gut feeling is that Mark could very well be right. While Apple continues to improve their toolset, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/APIs\">APIs</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Objective-C\">Objective-C</a> itself to make it easier to write threaded programs (some details of which are already known, and others we can&apos;t talk about in public until the wraps are off Leopard), the fundamental problem is that massively-parallel consumer systems are going to start arriving much faster than we&apos;re able to improve our threaded programming techniques.</p>\n<p>8-core consumer machines are already readily available; expect 16-core machines in the near future. The recent trend is clear that ongoing Moore&apos;s Law improvements are less and less about clock speed increases and more and more about increasing the number of cores and reducing the power consumption (performance per watt). Life would certainly be simpler if CPU performance had continued to increase purely from clock speed gains, but sadly it&apos;s already evident that that particular avenue for advancement is getting narrower and narrower.</p>\n<p>So for the purposes of illustration let&apos;s just assume that clock speeds will remain roughly constant from here on in but the number of cores will double every 18 months or so; this means we could have 128-core consumer machines in as little as 10 years. Whether or not these figures are wildly inaccurate doesn&apos;t really matter because the exact numbers are not important: what is clear is that the number of cores is on the way up and it&apos;s going to keep going up in a way that is going to make threaded programming harder and harder.</p>\n<p>As the number of threads goes up the difficulty of using the shared-memory model goes up too. Software doesn&apos;t necessarily get much faster (due to locking overhead, cache coherency requirements etc) and complexity goes up; the bug count probably goes up too.</p>\n<p>One approach to avoid the pitfalls of shared-memory is to use multiple processes rather than multiple threads. For some problems this will scale well, for others it will not.</p>\n<p>Functional programming is promising in this context because of a key attribute:</p>\n<blockquote>Unlike imperative programming languages, functional programming has no notion of state or side effects; functions merely have (immutable) inputs and (immutable) results. This means that things like execution order suddenly matter much less. This frees the compiler to be able to split the problem up across multiple cores without the programmer having to know about it.</blockquote>\n<p>This is precisely the kind of problem that can and should be solved by the compiler and not the programmer. In the days when computers only had 4KB of memory the programmer had to worry about allocating and hand-optimizing every last byte, but today in the age of vast pools of physical memory and almost unbounded virtual memory programmers no longer need to think about memory at the same level: sure, we think about not using too much of it, but we basically let the compiler handle all the <em>details</em>.</p>\n<p>As the number of cores increase we&apos;re going to see exactly the same progression. While in the &quot;old days&quot; it made sense for a programmer to think about and micro-manage a &quot;UI thread&quot; and a background &quot;work thread&quot;, for instance, in the future it will make much more sense for the programmer to forget about threads and just let the compiler make sure that all 128-cores are kept busy.</p>\n<p>This is much more likely to become possible with functional compilers because functional programming operates at a much higher abstract level than imperative languages. In imperative languages the programmer thinks like a machine; the programmer knows that the processor executes one instruction after another and the source-code reflects that sequential processing: &quot;do this, then do that, then do this&quot;.</p>\n<p>But in modern processors with deep pipelines, massive caches, out-of-order execution, and all sorts of hardware micro-optimizations <em>and</em> compiler-level optimizations, the relationship gets fuzzier and fuzzier between the sequence of instructions embodied in the source code and the <em>actual</em> sequence of execution, usually distributed across cores and processors, in reality.</p>\n<p>Functional programming offers an exit, freeing us from thinking about those implementation details and instead allowing us to think about problems and solutions in terms of data transformations. To illustrate, let&apos;s look at the canonical functional programming example, the factorial function:</p>\n<pre>fac 0 = 1\nfac n = fac (n - 1) * n</pre>\n<p>And a comparable implementation in an imperative language, in this case <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby\">Ruby</a>:</p>\n<pre>def fac n\n  n == 0 ? 1 : fac(n - 1) * n\nend</pre>\n<p>Note that there are many, many ways to implement a factorial function in both languages, but these simple versions will serve for the purposes of illustration.</p>\n<p>The imperative version is what you write when you think about the computer as a machine that executes algorithms as a series of steps. The design of the method is just a rephrasing of the actual machine code instructions you expect to be executed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check if <tt>n</tt> is equal to zero</li>\n<li>If it is, then return <tt>1</tt> (the factorial of 0 is 1)</li>\n<li>Otherwise, multiply <tt>n</tt> by the value of the factorial of <tt>n - 1</tt></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The fact that the method includes a recursive self-reference doesn&apos;t change the fact that the programmer thinks in terms of a series of steps, and that the thinking is predicated on the fact that the computer will execute the method as a series of steps as well.</p>\n<p>The functional version looks very similar at first glance, but don&apos;t let the appearance fool you. The difference is subtle precisely because calculating a factorial is such a simple mathematical function.</p>\n<p>First up, notice how the functional version is higher-level, more abstract, even if only a little in this example; that is, the source code of the function reads much more like a textbook definition of factorial than the imperative version.</p>\n<p>Secondly, notice that the functional version states <em>what</em> a factorial is rather than <em>how</em> it should be calculated. This point is key because it&apos;s at the core of why a compiler can in theory take a functional algorithm and figure out how to distribute it across multiple cores. The functional version does not state &quot;do this then do this&quot;; it instead states &quot;a factorial of a number <tt>n</tt> <em>is</em> this&quot;. The difference is subtle. Try to look at the function without automatically decomposing it into the series of steps that you believe the computer will perform behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>Finally, although this isn&apos;t explicitly visible in this example, note that the functional version is totally free of state and side-effects. Once again this grants the compiler an additional degree of freedom for splitting work up across cores. In the case of the imperative example there aren&apos;t any side-effects external to the method either, but the key point to note is that in imperative languages side-effects are possible and they are created, along with state all over the place. Pure functional languages, on the other hand, eschew state.</p>\n<p>In a future article I&apos;ll provide some more realistic examples which demonstrate why this apparent limitation is actually an amazing strength of the functional programming approach. In the meantime, <a href=\"http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html\">this article</a> explains the concurrency aspects of functional programming very well:</p>\n<blockquote>A functional program is ready for concurrency without any further modifications. You never have to worry about deadlocks and race conditions because you don&apos;t need to use locks! No piece of data in a functional program is modified twice by the same thread, let alone by two different threads. That means you can easily add threads without ever giving conventional problems that plague concurrency applications a second thought!<br><br>\nIf your application is inherently single threaded the compiler can still optimize functional programs to run on multiple CPUs. In a functional language the compiler could analyze the code, classify the functions that create strings s1 and s2 as potentially time consuming operations, and run them concurrently. This is impossible to do in an imperative language because each function may modify state outside of its scope and the function following it may depend on it. In functional languages automatic analysis of functions and finding good candidates for concurrent execution is as trivial as automatic inlining! In this sense functional style programs are &quot;future proof&quot; (as much as I hate buzzwords, I&apos;ll indulge this time). Hardware manufacturers can no longer make CPUs run any faster. Instead they increase the number of cores and attribute quadruple speed increases to concurrency. Of course they conveniently forget to mention that we get our money&apos;s worth only on software that deals with parallelizable problems. This is a very small fraction of imperative software but 100% of functional software because functional programs are all parallelizable out of the box.</blockquote>\n<p>So we&apos;re going to see the number of cores go up exponentially in the future and with it the complexity of the shared-memory model will go through the roof. I see three ways in which innovation is going to prevent all of this collapsing into a horrid mess:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Companies like Apple will continue to improve their frameworks, languages and tools to make it easier for programmers to do the right thing with respect to threads, and harder to do the wrong thing. Things like garbage collection help to address a bunch of thread-related memory management problems; monolithic APIs like Core Data are great for doing the &quot;heavy lifting&quot; and Apple is free to implement infrastructure there behind the API which works well on multiple cores (ditto for any of the &quot;high-performance&quot; APIs such as Core Image and friends) .</li>\n<li>Programmers will have to learn to distribute work across multiple processes, not multiple threads, because in many cases this will be more scalable and in most it will be more robust.</li>\n<li>Those supporting processes which don&apos;t need to interact with the user interface will probably be best written in a functional programming language, where the compiler can take on a large part of making the most of the opportunities for parallelism on a multi-core machine. (Even though there are already language bindings for wedding together Haskell and C code, I still expect most UI-level code on <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mac%20OS%20X\">Mac OS X</a> to be written in Objective-C, if for no other reason than that&apos;s what the frameworks do and will use, and that&apos;s where the impedance match is.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002696more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

And I don&apos;t think it is actually the application&apos;s fault but something in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mac%20OS%20X\">Mac OS X</a>. That&apos;s my intuition anyway.</p>\n<p>This isn&apos;t the catastrophic freeze from the Mac OS 9 days, nor the kernel panic of the modern era: instead, the computer continues on (seconds on clock continue to update, Dock icons animate, hard drive makes noise, mouse pointer moves) but your attempts at interaction with it have no effect. Clicking the mouse or pressing keys has no visible effect, mousing over the Dock doesn&apos;t produce any tool-tips; it&apos;s as though you were separated from your machine by a pane of glass.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you can &quot;jolt&quot; the machine out of such a state by hitting Option-Command-Escape. This only seems to work when the computer gets into a &quot;trapped-behind-glass&quot; moment <em>without</em> any apps crashing. The Force Quit window pops up and the computer is immediately back to normal, no need to actually go ahead and force quit anything at all. I end up having to do this about 4 or 5 times a day.</p>\n<p>But last night wasn&apos;t one of those moments. I patiently left the machine on all night to see if it would recover but it didn&apos;t.

No choice but to hard reset.</p>\n<p>As any regular reader of my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/involuntary_reboot_log/\">Involuntary Reboot Log</a> knows, I hate hard resets and I have absolutely zero faith in the ability of the HFS+ filesystem to maintain data integrity in the event of an irregular power cycling like that. But as I noted about <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/09/anchor.php\">10 days ago</a>, my machine is once again without a working optical drive, so booting off the Mac OS X install DVD to do repairs or a reinstall is no longer an option.</p>\n<p>So today I resigned myself to just go ahead and do the hard reset, kiss my open documents goodbye, and hope that HFS+ wouldn&apos;t screw me over. Imagine my surprise when upon booting the Super Drive was once again recognized by the system! Finally able to eject that Leopard seed disc that had been sitting in there for the last 10 days.

Thread-safety and speed were achieved by using a combination of synchronization, fast NSMapTable lookups, double-checked locking, and memory barriers.</p>\n\n<p>With the advent of garbage collection I revisited my solution once again and decided to scrap it in favor of a simpler, non-abstract model wherein each singleton class implemented the minimal necessary code to provide an &quot;advisory&quot; singleton. That is, rather than trying to enforce the singleton pattern by overriding allocWithZone: and init, I instead provide a simple sharedInstance (or similar) method which is documented as the preferred means of creating and using an instance of the class. Callers are free to call alloc/init multiple times if they wish, thus creating multiple instances, but the consequences are undefined; this could potentially be useful for testing purposes. My only attempt at &quot;enforcement&quot; is to override copyWithZone:; this is done to prevent inadvertent creation of multiple instances. For speed the sharedInstance method employs a simple double-checked locking pattern with memory barriers (much simpler than the generalized solution that had to work with the not-thread-safe NSMapTable).</p>\n\n<p>Although this approach requires a small amount of code per new singleton class, the result is faster, simpler and less likely to have unidentified bugs.</p>\n\n<p>Signed-off-by: Wincent Colaiuta &lt;win@wincent.com&gt; </p>",

It defines the key terms and measurements of scaling and explains why scaling in essence have nothing to do with Rails. It&apos;s a great story to have in hand when the inevitable fudzy &quot;But does it scale?&quot; nonsense is thrown at you.</blockquote>\n<p>The thing is, it seems that David is working with a very particular definition of &quot;scaling&quot; that seeks to sidestep the key issues at the heart of Rail&apos;s scaling problems (and there <em>are</em> problems). &quot;Scaling in essence has nothing to do with Rails&quot;. Really? <em>Nothing</em> at all? Nothing at all <em>in essence</em>? There are more than a couple words in there that are setting off the sophistry alarm bells...</p>\n<p>My personal opinion is that Rails is a pretty nice framework but that it is undeniably slow, resource hungry, and only &quot;scales&quot; when you throw bucket-loads of money at it. And of <em>course</em> it &quot;scales&quot; if you do that... But that doesn&apos;t make the performance problem vanish into thin air; it&apos;s still there and it&apos;s not &quot;fudzy nonsense&quot; but a legitimate concern.

    "html": "<p>One of the nice frills that comes with the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/distributed%20version%20control\">distributed version control</a> model of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a> is the ability to amend unpublished commits.</p>\n<p>With a client-server model your commits are permanent and instantly visible, which means that if you make a mistake your only choice is to publish <em>another</em> commit correcting the mistake made in the first commit.</p>\n<p>Normally this inability to rewrite history isn&apos;t such a bad thing as it is both a faithful record of the actual development process (warts and all) and also helps shield you from accidentally losing information.</p>\n<p>But there is a common workflow that keeps cropping up and that is the need to make <em>minor</em> corrections to the last commit. Perhaps you see a spelling error in your commit message but by the time you catch it your finger is already falling down on the Enter key and your spelling mistake is immortalized for all time. Because Git uses a distributed model when you do a <tt>git commit</tt> you&apos;re not actually sending out any changes over the wire; you&apos;re just committing them to your local repository. It&apos;s not until you do a <tt>git push</tt> that your commits actually get pushed out across the net to an upstream, publicly-visible repository. This is in contrast to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SVK\">SVK</a>, which always pushes changes back upstream as soon as you commit them.</p>\n<p>This means that if your changes haven&apos;t been pushed out yet, nobody can have seen them and so there&apos;s no harm in amending that last commit. You do this by making any tweaks you want in the commit, adding them to the index with <tt>git add</tt> and finally using <tt>git commit --amend</tt> to finalize your amendment. Git conveniently populates the editor with your last commit message which you can modify (or not) at will. You can amend the same commit multiple times if need be.</p>\n<p>More examples.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the act of writing your commit messages causes you to reflect about the change and in doing so you realize that there&apos;s actually one more little thing that you&apos;d like to be included in the commit. You can continue on, finish writing your commit message and exit the editor, then run <tt>git commit --amend</tt> afterwards to include your addition.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s of course a good thing to check your proposed changes <em>before</em> you make a commit but I often like to review them <em>afterwards</em> as well (using <tt>git log</tt> and <tt>git show</tt>). Often in these reviews you&apos;ll see minor anomalies you&apos;d like to fix like whitespace problems and the like. <tt>git commit --amend</tt> is your friend in this case too.</p>\n<p>Along with <tt>git stash</tt> this is one of those workflow sweeteners that has me thankful and smiling and glad to be using Git every time I have need of them (which often turns out to be several times a day).</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002762more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Lately <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mail.app\">Mail.app</a> has only been returning a subset of the expected results when I search for a particular mail. For example, if a customer that purchased a <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">Synergy</a> license in the last week asks for their registration information to be resent then I can find it, usually within seconds; but if someone who purchased back in 2003 asks me then Mail.app never turns up any results. Using <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Spotlight\">Spotlight</a> from outside of Mail.app also fails to return any results even though the emails are <em>known</em> to exist, so I can only conclude that Spotlight is broken. A manual search (sorting by column, manually scrolling, and visually scanning) is not a viable option; I have 6 GB of mail dating as far back as 1996.</p>\n<p>In other words, given that Mail.app depends on Spotlight for its searching, a broken Spotlight leads to a broken mail application as well. In these cases I have to engage in a time-consuming search which involves logging into PayPal to find a record of a transaction which took place almost five years ago, and I can then confirm using <tt>grep -R</tt> from the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/command%20line\">command line</a> that the registration notice is indeed still present in my <tt>~/Library/Mail/</tt> folder.</p>\n<p>So Spotlight is great when it works, principally because it&apos;s so fast. But if forced to choose between slow and broken, I&apos;ll chose slow every time. I just blew away the Spotlight index for my startup volume (<tt>sudo mdutil -E /</tt>) and it will now be rebuilt automatically (will take many hours &#x2014; the Spotlight menu bar is telling me that there are 23 hours remaining &#x2014; and the ultra-flakey <tt>mdimportserver</tt> process has <em>already</em> crashed, only two minutes into the scan).

    "html": "<p>Without a doubt I have a love-hate relationship with AppKit and Foundation. Basically it boils down to loving working with Foundation and hating working with AppKit. They&apos;re both amazing frameworks, but it&apos;s almost always AppKit that has me pulling my hair out in frustration.</p>\n<p>Example. Trying to rapidly prototype a new view hierarchy you programmatically set up a grid of nested NSView subclasses and in their <tt>drawRect:</tt> methods you just use <tt>NSRectFill()</tt> to draw blocks of color so that you can see that they are correctly laid out.</p>\n<p>You override <tt>resizeSubviewsWithOldSize:</tt> because you have some complex autoresizing behaviour that you need to implement and the built-in Cocoa stuff doesn&apos;t give you the results you want.</p>\n<p>Up to this point working with AppKit has been a relatively pleasant experience. But that&apos;s about to change. 2 AM in the morning and you change one of your classes to be an NSTextView subclass rather than an NSView subclasses; that is you change <em>only</em>:</p>\n<pre>@interface MyView : NSView</pre>\n<p>To:</p>\n<pre>@interface MyView : NSTextView</pre>\n<p>This is supposed to be rapid prototyping and that means making a succession of minimal, incremental changes: modify, test, repeat. At this point AppKit derails your efforts by exhibiting bizarre redrawing behaviour. Given that NSTextView is itself a subclass of NSView you would not expect that changing the superclass of a basically empty custom view implementation would have such a radical effect on its behaviour. But it does.</p>\n<p>The view&apos;s frame and bounds look to be the right size, but the frame is inexplicably creeping upwards whenever you resize the window vertically. It doesn&apos;t happen horizontally, however, so your first suspicion is that it might have something to do with the <tt>isHorizontallyResizable</tt> and <tt>isVerticallyResizable</tt> properties; according to the docs, NSText (NSTextView&apos;s immediate superclass) is vertically resizable by default but not horizontally. Playing with these values has no effect, however, and to make things more complicated the frame isn&apos;t really <em>creeping</em> upwards at all: it&apos;s jumping upwards in variably-sized leaps.</p>\n<p>AppKit is closed source and that makes it a gigantic, complicated, black box that you can&apos;t look inside to figure out what the heck is going on. I&apos;ve been in this situation many times before with AppKit and I know better than to stay up all night inserting <tt>NSLog</tt> statements and what not trying to work out what&apos;s happening. Today is a new day. Will see if I can figure this out. Hopefully by the time I get to the bottom of it my code won&apos;t resemble a filthy rat&apos;s nest of hard-to-understand workarounds and re-implementations of stuff I should have been able to inherit without modification. If I can&apos;t get this working within the next hour or two I&apos;ll just jettison NSTextView entirely and do everything with my own custom NSView class. What fun.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002768more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Simplifying dramatically, there are basically two main views on piracy among software developers.</p>\n<a name=\"Take%201\"></a><h3>Take 1</h3>\n\n<p>The first is simply, <em>don&apos;t worry about it</em>. Let&apos;s take some examples. <a href=\"http://nothirst.com/\">Kevin Hoctor</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>After years of being forced to design stronger and stronger activation/protection systems for the software I created, I&apos;m very done with all that. If a small percentage of my potential customer base are thieves, then they can steal my software and I&apos;m not losing sleep over it. I&apos;m just going to continue to use moderate protection (AquaticPrime combined with limiting functionality prior to licensing) to promote a quicker sales decision and not to pretend I can stop the crackers that will take it no matter what protection I write.</blockquote>\n<p>Another example; <a href=\"http://nslog.com/2005/06/26/qotd_piracy\">Erik J. Barzeski</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>Freshly Squeezed Software&apos;s approach to piracy... is, basically, to ignore piracy. We always tried, at FSS, to make sure honest people paid up, but nothing more. None of our software even blocked pirated codes -- it wasn&apos;t worth the effort to maintain such a list. The pirates would simply generate a new code, and we&apos;d add that to the list, and it&apos;d become a vicious cycle that took development time away from actual features.</blockquote>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002779more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p><a href=\"http://wilshipley.com/blog/2005/06/piracy.html\">Wil Shipley</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>Don&apos;t worry much about piracy. If you spend more than a couple days a year worrying about it, you&apos;re fooling yourself.<br><br>Here&apos;s the simple facts: pirates steal applications. They don&apos;t pay for them. It doesn&apos;t hurt you to have something &quot;stolen&quot; that (a) is virtual and (b) wasn&apos;t going to be purchased.</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.red-sweater.com/\">Daniel Jalkut</a> adds:</p>\n<blockquote>What complicates this issue even more is that nobody can say definitively whether piracy hurts or helps a small-time startup software business.<br><br>The complexity only hardens my determination to just keep building better software.<br><br>Things I know sell software:<br><br>- Better software (features, aesthetics, usability, reliability).<br><br>- Word of mouth/buzz/publicity/press.<br><br>- Good customer service.<br><br>There&apos;s so much work laid out for me right there, why bother working in an area (piracy control) that I&apos;m not sure about? Yet many developers seem to make piracy-control their number one priority. It&apos;s because they&apos;re too fixated on the concept of a lost dollar. But a lost dollar from a pirate who uses your software is no more real than a lost dollar from a potential customer who hates that you never work on updates that matter to them, or who notices that your app requires activation, or who gets the impression from your sales rhetoric that you hate users, etc.<br><br>I&apos;m not successful enough at all this yet to really preach the truth, but my sales do go up every month, and it has nothing to do with anti-piracy measures, because I don&apos;t work on them at all.</blockquote>\n<p>All of these positions are basically the same and amount to doing &quot;nothing&quot; or &quot;almost nothing&quot; with respect to piracy. In reality those that say &quot;nothing&quot; really mean &quot;almost nothing&quot; seeing as they all implement at least basic license code systems, so there really is a high degree of consensus here. These quotes come from developers who are successful and well-known to varying degrees within the Mac software development community, and it&apos;s hard to argue with the reasonableness of their positions.</p>\n<a name=\"Take%202\"></a><h3>Take 2</h3>\n\n<p>The other perspective on piracy is that you <em>should</em> &quot;worry&quot; about piracy. There is plenty of evidence that lots of developers think this way, as evidenced by the number of mailing list posts from people asking about how to implement license code schemes, how to implement activation, whether they should let their apps &quot;phone home&quot; or not, how to obfuscate their executables and so forth. I won&apos;t provide concrete quotes to illustrate this but if you spend time observing the developer community sooner or later you&apos;ll see the evidence for yourself.</p>\n<a name=\"My%20take\"></a><h3>My take</h3>\n\n<p>I basically agree with the first camp. You should encourage honest users to pay and that means implementing a license code scheme. Beyond that you shouldn&apos;t worry too much about it. How much is &quot;too much&quot;? Well, unlike Erik I don&apos;t think that even blacklists are too much, given that you can maintain such a blacklist in less than ten minutes per month. In fact I&apos;d say that even an hour per month wouldn&apos;t be too much work to put into anti-piracy measures as that&apos;s still only 12 hours per year. But any more than that and you&apos;re starting to get into the diminishing returns zone.</p>\n<p>I think that under concrete circumstances a lax approach to piracy really can affect your sales, and measurably, but those concrete examples almost never arise; specifically, if you sell the only product that fills a certain niche, and there are no free competitors, and no cheaper commercial competitors. Nowadays those circumstances only turn up for brief moments; as soon as you have a good idea it is guaranteed that free and commercial competitors copying the idea will pop up. What this means is that in basically all cases piracy is going to hurt your sales much less than competition from other products will; and that in turn means that you should divert your resources towards competing (improving your product) and away from combatting piracy.</p>\n<p>This is something I&apos;ve learnt in my own business. When <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com/\">Synergy</a> first came out back in 2002 it featured some really original ideas. Competitors quickly sprung up and copied those ideas but they didn&apos;t have the same &quot;mindshare&quot; and so they weren&apos;t really an issue at first. In those days piracy <em>did</em> have a measurable effect. Basically you could watch the sales graph respond to two factors: releasing a new version produced an upwards bump in sales followed by a gradual tapering off, and the publication of a new pirate serial number produced a sudden downwards drop in sales. So in that case blacklisting pirate serial numbers really did make sense (and it probably does anyway seeing as it is so darn easy, literally a question of only a couple of minutes&apos; work, and I think there are a significant number of honest people that will readily pay if they can&apos;t find a license code; these aren&apos;t hardcore pirates bent on getting stuff for free at any cost, but people who will use a pirate serial to get an &quot;extended trial&quot; if it&apos;s easy enough, and checking Serial Box is definitely easy).</p>\n<p>Now, five years later I am convinced that the impact of piracy has dropped off to the point where it is really irrelevant compared to other factors like marketplace competition. Now there really is no measurable effect. You could speculate, but it would be awfully hard to measure or prove anything.</p>\n<p>Back in the days when piracy was a real problem I started to work on anti-piracy technology. I basically explored all the usual methods: license codes generated using strong cryptography, product activation, self-checksumming executables, encrypted executables, obfuscated symbol names, obfuscated strings. My goal with all this was to make stuff that was easy for me to maintain (zero time investment; everything had to be totally automated from within Xcode and require no extra manual work) but which would be enough of a disincentive to dissuade pirates from publishing cracks, or at least from publishing cracks for every single release of the darn software.</p>\n<p>It has been fairly effective: <a href=\"http://advance.wincent.com/\">Synergy Advance</a> has used bits of that technology and has never been cracked (of course it could be cracked if the pirates really wanted to, but the technology as it stands has been sufficient to make it &quot;not worth it&quot; in at least the two years since I first starting publishing preview builds). My view with respect to activation was to try it in an unobtrusive way that didn&apos;t impact paying customers and I think I was largely successful in that regard, but my position was always that it was something that I would try out and I&apos;d turn it off without hesitation if I felt that it wasn&apos;t meeting the goals I had in mind for it. With respect to the complex stuff like self-checksumming and encrypted executables my perspective was always, &quot;This is a nice thing to have and it&apos;s been interesting to develop it, but if Apple changes their OS in such a way as to break it I&apos;ll just remove it and throw it out in a heartbeat&quot;.</p>\n<p>Now that I don&apos;t see piracy as so relevant anymore I am thinking of just giving all that anti-piracy stuff away (as open source or in some other format); it may still be useful to some developers who work in sectors where piracy matters.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p><em>In general</em> I never throw out any mail, apart from spam that is. I have personal mails dating back as far as 1996; prior to that I only had email at my university and I never had an archive of the very oldest messages (which probably date from 1994).</p>\n<p>Lately my homedir backups have been getting uncomfortably large because my <tt>~/Library/Mail/</tt> folder alone was weighing in at over 6GB.</p>\n<p>Instead of hanging on to my mailing list archives (my <a href=\"http://lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/cocoa-dev\">cocoa-dev</a> folder is now a gigabyte) I&apos;ve decided that I&apos;m going to trust <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Google\">Google</a> to index them for me and Apple to keep a copy of every message.</p>\n<p>I&apos;ve also been throwing out old attachments. Generally if an attachment is important I save it elsewhere immediately (media, for example, usually end up getting imported into iTunes or iPhoto). But I&apos;ve started going back over old emails and stripping off all attachments. I figure if I haven&apos;t looked at it in the last month or so then I&apos;ll probably never need to. Note that this doesn&apos;t actually result in any size saving until you rebuild the corresponding mailbox.</p>\n<p>The other thing is that the oldest messages have survived many generations of import/export from and to various email clients. I&apos;ve used <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mail.app\">Mail.app</a> pretty much from the beginning on <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mac%20OS%20X\">Mac OS X</a>, but prior to that I used Eudora, Outlook Express and Entourage; I may even have used Netscape Mail at one point but I can&apos;t remember. </p>\n<p>Along the way some information has been lost of mangled. After rebuilding I noticed that a lot of really old mails were showing up with today&apos;s date and the time at which I performed the rebuild. On inspecting the corresponding <tt>mbox</tt> file (200 megabytes in size and containing 300 million lines) I saw entries that had headers like this:</p>\n<pre>From ???@??? Fri Oct 06 12:07:24 2000\nDate: Sun, 16 Apr 2000 12:20:21 +0930\nFrom: Actual sender &lt;sender@example.com&gt;</pre>\n<p>Presumably the October 2000 datestamp is corresponds to one of my imports because lots of emails shared that date. The April 2000 datestamp looks to be correct one.</p>\n<p>I was pleased to see that if I replaced the string <tt>???@???</tt> with a valid address then the timestamp showed up correctly in Mail.app again, even without rebuilding. This is a relatively simple change to make and can be semi-automated; unfortunately only <em>semi</em>, so I won&apos;t be doing it for all my mailboxes just yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Looks like I spoke to soon. Although my test modification worked, going back and fixing and the occurrences in the mailbox didn&apos;t have any effect at all, even after rebuilding.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002784more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>When I first got on the Internet I used to want to know about email as soon as it was sent to me. I always set the checking interval to the minimum available; I can&apos;t remember what this was at first, but it was in the ballpark of 5, 10 or 15 minutes. When I got a mail client that could check every minute I dropped the interval to a minute.</p>\n<p>Then came spam. The came customers. Then came mailing lists with ever greater traffic. Over the years I&apos;ve tried to get smarter and smarter about spam, principally by using good filtering and classifying (<a href=\"http://c-command.com/spamsieve/\">SpamSieve</a> is the shining star of the troop), some conservative server-side blacklisting, and not by trying to hide my email address (<a href=\"mailto:win@wincent.com\">win@wincent.com</a>).</p>\n<p>Nowadays spam &quot;only&quot; takes about an hour of my time each month; the hour in which I clean out my spam mailbox, looking for false positives, and training <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SpamAssassin\">SpamAssassin</a> on its false negatives (for me SpamAssassin still only catches less than half the spam that SpamSieve does). In fact one of the reasons I&apos;m writing this post is that today was my cleanout day; I&apos;ve processed over 9,000 spam messages.</p>\n<p>But even with good anti-spam tech that still left me with a lot of email. I&apos;m not sure exactly when I did this, but some time ago, probably about a year or two I cranked my checking interval up from the minimum to the maximum: 1 hour in the case of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mail.app\">Mail.app</a>. In this way I could still respond to customers promptly but I was no longer getting distracted by mailing list posts spilling into my inbox and clamouring for my attention in my <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Dock\">Dock</a>.</p>\n<p>Last night and today I took a step further, unsubscribing from some non-essential lists and putting pretty much all the high-volume ones into digest mode. I don&apos;t like digests -- they&apos;re hard to read and hard to search -- but I need to do something to free myself from the time tyranny that email has had over me up until now. The truth is that in most cases I am a lurker, a reader; I tune in in the hope of picking up tips, keeping up to date and learning about stuff. But even skimming and scanning, quickly glancing at about 5% of all that comes in, still takes too much time when you&apos;re dealing with large volumes. If you&apos;re not an active participant then a digest is probably good enough.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002792more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<a name=\"Is%20spam%20getting%20better%20or%20worse%3F\"></a><h3>Is spam getting better or worse?</h3>\n\n<p>Comparing with <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/02/is_spam_solved.php\">the numbers</a> from the last time (about 8 months ago) things look decidedly worse; these are the numbers at the client level, excluding spam that was blocked by the server:</p>\n<pre>Filtered Mail\n238,770 Good Messages\n91,796 Spam Messages (28%)\n86 Spam Messages per Day\n\nSpamSieve Accuracy\n268 False Positives\n917 False Negatives (77%)\n99.6% Correct\n\nCorpus\n4,001 Good Messages\n5,274 Spam Messages (57%)\n306,099 Total Words\n\nRules\n1,318 Blocklist Rules\n6,817 Whitelist Rules\n\nShowing Statistics Since\n10/11/2004 11:42</pre>\n<p>So the number of spams per day has jumped up by 12, and as a whole spams now account for 28% of all mail arriving at the client, up from 24%.

    "html": "<p><a href=\"http://fukamachi.org/wp/2007/10/06/thinking-about-changing-unixes/\">Sho Fukamachi writes</a> that he&apos;s thinking about switching away from <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/RHEL\">RHEL</a> 4. I&apos;ve been thinking about a lot of the same issues lately and rather than cram my response into a comment on his post I&apos;m instead writing it out in full here.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002799more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>His main gripe with RHEL is that the software it comes with is old and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Red%20Hat\">Red Hat</a> only provides security fixes. For example, RHEL 3 comes with Apache 2.0 and even though the OS will have official &quot;maintenance support&quot; up until 2010 (see &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Red%20Hat%20Enterprise%20Linux%20support%20policy%20(EOL%20dates)\">Red Hat Enterprise Linux support policy (EOL dates)</a>&quot;) you will never, ever see  Red Hat upgrading the Apache install to the 2.1 or 2.2 series. They simply backport everything.</p>\n<p>For the mission-critical applications domain this is brilliant. It basically means that you&apos;ve got a <em>solid</em> platform that won&apos;t change underneath you. You&apos;re secure because Red Hat pushes out security fixes promptly using their automated <tt>up2date</tt> tool and the Red Hat Network, and you know that your applications won&apos;t suddenly stop working due to an upgrade. In short, it&apos;s <em>awesome</em> peace of mind when you&apos;re running a business.</p>\n<p>Like Sho, I&apos;ve got 10 years of experience maintaining servers that run FreeBSD, Solaris, and a number of Linux distros; the novelty wears off after a while and you start to truly appreciate the bedrock-like solidity offered by the RHEL platform.</p>\n<p>The problem is that sometimes you don&apos;t have any real choice but to run a later version of these server applications. Third-party software starts requiring newer and newer versions of stuff and your only options are to either not install it, install an old version which doesn&apos;t have the newer requirements (but probably does have unpatched security flaws), or break with Red Hat support and wing it on your own by installing newer versions of the software.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Rails\">Rails</a> is the highest profile example here, but there are plenty of other humble <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/PHP\">PHP</a> apps like <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/MediaWiki\">MediaWiki</a>, for instance, that are bumping up their version requirements and you can no longer run the latest and greatest on RHEL 3 without making some difficult choices.</p>\n<p>In my own case I&apos;ve really appreciated the rock solidity of Red Hat&apos;s support, but I&apos;ve had to pass on installing software which required things not available on RHEL 3, including Rails. The one area in which I really had no choice at all was for my database: I had a critical application that required at least <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/MySQL\">MySQL</a> 4.1, there was no time to modify it, and RHEL 3 still ships with MySQL 3.23. So that&apos;s the one core application that I manually maintain, while leaving Apache, PHP, and all the other updates up to Red Hat. I also manually install a bunch of other software with which I want or need to keep current (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion\">Subversion</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a>, for example, among others).</p>\n<p>I personally think that RHEL 5 is the light at the end of the tunnel. Not just because it has newer versions of Apache, PHP and everything else <em>right now</em>; after all, in 2014 RHEL 5 will still be officially supported by Red Hat but you can rest assured that its Apache install will be far behind the times at that point.</p>\n<p>The real reason why RHEL 5 is the magic bullet is its virtualization technology. Basically, your host OS will always be RHEL 5 with the stock standard, totally bullet-proof Red Hat-supported application stack. When the day comes along that you need to install Apache 3.0 for some ultra-modern application you&apos;ll no longer need to break a sweat, because you can create a virtualized &quot;guest&quot; machine and install Apache 3.0 <em>only in that</em> sandbox. Suddenly the risks of breaking with Red Hat support don&apos;t seem so bad anymore.</p>\n<p>You can also rest assured that if you should ever want to upgrade to RHEL 6, or RHEL 7, that you&apos;ll be able to set up a new install and just run your old RHEL 5 set-up inside a virtual guest on the new host. You&apos;ll have all the time in the world to gradually migrate applications over; in fact, you don&apos;t <em>ever</em> have to do it if you don&apos;t want to.</p>\n<p>So basically that&apos;s why I&apos;m excited about switching to RHEL 5. It seems like the best of both worlds: the peace of mind that only truly &quot;enterprise&quot; support can bring; and the flexibility that you sometimes need, especially important when you&apos;re depending on a third party for your applications and you don&apos;t set the requirements.</p>\n<p>I&apos;m also excited because moving to RHEL 5 means I&apos;ll be able to move this site over to Rails at the same time, and that will be a massive simplification too (despite the fact that Rails is a pain to deploy). Instead of worrying about a host of web applications written in different languages (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Perl\">Perl</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Python\">Python</a>, PHP etc) with different requirements, I can just have <em>one</em> language, <em>one</em> framework, and <em>one</em> set of dependencies. Moving will be a <em>huge</em> project, and it&apos;s not one that I&apos;ve even contemplated starting in the next few months, but I anticipate that the rewards will make it worthwhile.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>The other day I <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/10/mail_as_a_time.php\">wrote</a> about how much time I waste each month on dealing with spam messages; specifically with training <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SpamAssassin\">SpamAssassin</a> to learn from its mistakes. <a href=\"http://guelich.net/\">Scott Guelich</a> wrote in with a couple of suggestions to trim some time off the process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take your wrapper script (the one that invokes <tt>sa-learn</tt>) and set it up in a cron job so that you don&apos;t have to manually run it when you want to train bad messages.</li>\n<li>Have the wrapper delete messages once processed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So in my case this means setting up a couple of new crontab entries that look something like this:</p>\n<pre>15 14 1 * *     sa-learn --spam --mbox &quot;${HOME}/mail/train-spam&quot; &gt; /dev/null &amp;&amp; echo -n &quot;&quot; &gt; &quot;${HOME}/mail/train-spam&quot;\n20 14 1 * *     sa-learn --ham --mbox &quot;${HOME}/mail/train-ham&quot; &gt; /dev/null &amp;&amp; echo -n &quot;&quot; &gt; &quot;${HOME}/mail/train-ham&quot;</pre>\n<p>Even more valuable for me, however, was that Scott&apos;s email prompted me to think about <em>the</em> major element which causes spam training to be such a pain for me. The problem is that <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SpamSieve\">SpamSieve</a> dumps all of your spam into one folder, even if it came from different accounts, and that makes SpamAssassin training difficult because to properly train you should really train each account separately. Sorting the messages according to which account they came from can be quite painful because spammers often use garbage &quot;To:&quot; headers and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mail.app\">Mail.app</a> doesn&apos;t provide an &quot;Account&quot; column which would make sorting easy.</p>\n<p>So on thinking about it a bit more I realize that although the SpamSieve docs lead me to set up things this way there is really no reason why I can&apos;t have it process each account&apos;s incoming mail separately and then store the spam in per-account folders. I think this simple change is going to save me a <em>lot</em> of time. I expect my time wasted on spam to drop down from about 1 hour to 5 minutes or less per month.</p>\n<a name=\"Update\"></a><h3>Update</h3>\n\n<p>Playing with the new set-up reveals only one glitch in the workflow: if I use the &quot;Train as spam&quot; menu item to flag false negatives to SpamSieve then they wind up in my general spam folder, the one shared by all email accounts, rather than in the appropriate account-specific folder. Hopefully given SpamSieve&apos;s accuracy this won&apos;t become too much of a problem.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002807more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>A minor peeve about the <tt>rails</tt> commandline tool.</p>\n\n<p>When trying to upgrade an existing app using the new Rails 2.0 preview release you&apos;ll inevitably be presented with a choice like this:</p>\n\n<pre>      exists  vendor/plugins\n      exists  tmp/sessions\n      exists  tmp/sockets\n      exists  tmp/cache\n      exists  tmp/pids\n   identical  Rakefile\noverwrite README? [Ynaqd]</pre>\n\n<p>What do the options mean here? <tt>Y</tt> most likely means &quot;<strong>y</strong>es&quot;, <tt>n</tt> &quot;<strong>n</strong>o&quot;, and <tt>a</tt> probably means &quot;overwrite <strong>a</strong>ll&quot;. But <tt>q</tt> and <tt>d</tt>? It turns out that they mean &quot;<strong>q</strong>uit&quot; and &quot;show a <strong>d</strong>iff&quot; respectively. Perhaps I could have guessed this, but I had to dig into the Rails source code to find out, and you just shouldn&apos;t have to do that.</p>\n\n<p>This is bad UI design. My first attempt at finding out what the options meant was doing a <tt>man rails</tt> but Rails doesn&apos;t have a man page. My next try was <tt>rails --help</tt> but that provides no information about the abbreviations that might crop up. Finally the <tt>README</tt> that is installed with new Rails apps doesn&apos;t appear to make any mention of this either.</p>\n\n<p>I wondered if <tt>h</tt> might provide &quot;<strong>h</strong>elp&quot;, so I tried it and boom, what do I see?</p>\n\n<pre>       force  README</pre>\n\n<p>So <tt>h</tt> forces an overwrite. Not very helpful.</p>\n\n<p>So one is forced to dig into <tt>/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/rails-1.2.4.7794/lib/rails_generator/commands.rb</tt> and inspect the source code in order to figure out what&apos;s going on.</p>\n\n<div id=\"a002809more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>Here&apos;s the code:</p>\n\n<pre>def force_file_collision?(destination, src, dst, file_options = {}, &amp;block)\n  $stdout.print &quot;overwrite #{destination}? [Ynaqd] &quot;\n  case $stdin.gets\n    when /d/i\n      Tempfile.open(File.basename(destination), File.dirname(dst)) do |temp|\n        temp.write render_file(src, file_options, &amp;block)\n        temp.rewind\n        $stdout.puts `#{diff_cmd} #{dst} #{temp.path}`\n      end\n      puts &quot;retrying&quot;\n      raise &apos;retry diff&apos;\n    when /a/i\n      $stdout.puts &quot;forcing #{spec.name}&quot;\n      options[:collision] = :force\n    when /q/i\n      $stdout.puts &quot;aborting #{spec.name}&quot;\n      raise SystemExit\n    when /n/i then :skip\n    else :force\n  end\nrescue\n  retry\nend</pre>\n\n<p>So here we see what the various options do and we also see why <tt>h</tt> caused things to be overwritten: the <em>default</em> action is to force an overwrite. Whoever thought that <em>that</em> was a bright idea? Good thing we all use version control, eh? Also note that the regular expressions used in the <tt>case</tt> statement will match the letters <em>anywhere</em> they appear in the input string, so if you type &quot;xxxazzz&quot; then that&apos;s equivalent to typing &quot;a&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>How could this have been done better? Well, first up it should display a more helpful prompt:</p>\n\n<pre>overwrite README? (enter &quot;h&quot; for help) [Ynaqdh]</pre>\n\n<p>Secondly it should show detailed help for unknown options instead of just forcing the overwrite:</p>\n\n<pre>Y - yes, overwrite\nn - no, do not overwrite\na - all, overwrite this and all others\nq - quit, abort\nd - diff, show the differences between the old and the new\nh - help, show this help\noverwrite README? (enter &quot;h&quot; for help) [Ynaqdh]</pre>\n\n<p>And thirdly it shouldn&apos;t use such sloppy regexes.</p>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve submitted <a href=\"http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/9842\">a patch</a> with these fixes which has now been <a href=\"http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/7837\">applied</a> to the trunk.</p>\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>I&apos;m getting closer to my support system &quot;holy grail&quot;: the ability to have a web-based issue tracker (like <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Bugzilla\">Bugzilla</a>) which you can control easily via email. Keeping everything on the web makes the development process much more visible and accessible to customers, but working from within the comfort of an email client is often a much more pleasant way of interacting with the system, especially seeing as 90% of developer and customer interaction with an issue tracking system consists of updating tickets with additional bits of information or short replies.</p>\n<p>Now, Bugzilla itself actually already provides a degree of email-control, and other systems like Lighthouse <a href=\"http://www.lighthouseapp.com/help/how-do-i-send-emails-to-lighthouse\">do too</a>. But I&apos;m looking for something easier to use than Bugzilla and want an in-house, integrated solution rather than an off-site paid service like Lighthouse.</p>\n<a name=\"The%20old\"></a><h3>The old</h3>\n\n<p>I currently have <a href=\"http://bugs.wincent.com/\">a Bugzilla install</a> set up for taking feature requests and bug reports, a <a href=\"https://secure.wincent.com/a/support/tickets/\">custom support ticket interface</a> for support issues, and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/contact/mail/\">a contact form</a> for other enquiries (along with my email address, <a href=\"mailto:win@wincent.com\">win@wincent.com</a>, which is plastered all over the site). Three of my applications also have a custom crash reporter that can email in crash reports if things blow up.</p>\n<a name=\"The%20new\"></a><h3>The new</h3>\n\n<p>All of this is going to be replaced with a single unified issue tracker. There will be five categories of tickets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Feature requests</em>: &quot;I wish your app would do <em>this</em>...&quot;</li>\n<li><em>Bug reports</em>: &quot;This doesn&apos;t work like I expect...&quot;</li>\n<li><em>Crash reports</em>: &quot;Things went boom...&quot;</li>\n<li><em>Feedback</em>: &quot;I have a suggestion or comment...&quot;</li>\n<li><em>Support tickets</em>: &quot;How do I do <em>X</em>?&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In reality all of these tickets are the same; there&apos;s only one issue tracker and there&apos;s only one (extremely simple) interface to learn. The categories are really just there to help me organize issues into groups.</p>\n<p>So right there you&apos;ve got your easy-to-use Bugzilla replacement. What do tickets look like? They&apos;re really just a summary (one-line) followed by a description with a space for comments underneath. There is a small amount of metadata that&apos;s provided as well (things like ticket number, creation and modification date, status field and what not) but not enough to be overwhelming.</p>\n<p>The bit which really has me drooling is the email integration. You can of course open a new ticket via the web interface, but if you want to do it via email basically all you have to do is send an email to <a href=\"mailto:features@wincent.com\">features@wincent.com</a>, <a href=\"mailto:bugs@wincent.com\">bugs@wincent.com</a>, <a href=\"mailto:feedback@wincent.com\">feedback@wincent.com</a> or <a href=\"mailto:support@wincent.com\">support@wincent.com</a> (you don&apos;t need to manually create crash report tickets because those are opened by the built-in crash reporter).</p>\n<p>When a change is made to your ticket you&apos;ll get an email. To add a comment just reply to the email, keeping the subject line intact (the subject line has the ticket number in it).</p>\n<p>Obviously in order for this to be workable it needs to have good support for coping with spam. I&apos;m working on that, and am fairly confident that it should be kept under control. Or to put it another way, I am expecting a <em>lot</em> of spam but I am also expecting to be able to sweep it under the carpet with relative ease. So that means a great admin interface for managing spam, probably some kind of Akismet-like filtering, built-in blacklisting, basic authentication based on the <tt>From:</tt> header (easily forged, I know, but this is just one layer in a &quot;<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/defense%20in%20depth\">defense in depth</a>&quot; strategy), and probably the use of a secret token (messages will still get through without the token, but they&apos;ll be moderated).</p>\n<a name=\"Update\"></a><h3>Update</h3>\n\n<p>Actually, it&apos;s better than all that. I&apos;ve started working on an email interface that&apos;ll be even easier for customers to use: instead of having multiple email addresses to interact with, all incoming mail will go to one address (<a href=\"mailto:support@wincent.com\">support@wincent.com</a>) and from there a Bayesian classifier will be used to filter out the spam <em>and</em> take a stab at guessing what kind of inquiry it is. This should be much nicer for customers as they won&apos;t even have to think about what email address to send their message to.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002815more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

I have my own preferences which I apply to projects that I control, and I try to adhere to the standards set by other projects when making contributions to them, but I don&apos;t bother pouring more fuel on the fire when this kind of debate is raging on a mailing list.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002819more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>If you check out the top <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Google\">Google</a> hits on the subject you&apos;ll get some nice arguments on both sides, some interesting proposals, as well as some questionable affirmations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.jwz.org/doc/tabs-vs-spaces.html\">http://www.jwz.org/doc/tabs-vs-spaces.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/cyrusn/archive/2004/09/14/229474.aspx\">http://blogs.msdn.com/cyrusn/archive/2004/09/14/229474.aspx</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/stevejs/archive/2005/10/30/487102.aspx\">http://blogs.msdn.com/stevejs/archive/2005/10/30/487102.aspx</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.derkarl.org/why_to_tabs.html\">http://www.derkarl.org/why_to_tabs.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://xahlee.org/UnixResource_dir/writ/tabs_vs_spaces.html\">http://xahlee.org/UnixResource_dir/writ/tabs_vs_spaces.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nickgravgaard.com/elastictabstops/\">http://nickgravgaard.com/elastictabstops/</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you skim over those you should have a fairly thorough grounding in both sides of the argument.</p>\n<p>I&apos;ve pretty much always preferred spaces over tabs for the following reason:</p>\n<blockquote>Spaces give you total control over how your code will appear when others view it.</blockquote>\n<p>Kind of like sending a PDF rather than a proprietary Word document. But it&apos;s also easy to see why people like Torvalds hold precisely the opposite point of view:</p>\n<blockquote>Tabs allow the viewer to determine how code looks when they view it.</blockquote>\n<p>Using tabs for indentation (to show scope) and then spaces for additional alignment might produce code that looks pretty good everywhere <em>and</em> has a degree of viewer-configurability, <em>but</em> it suffers from what is in my view a fatal flaw: it requires users editing the text to manipulate invisible symbols. Sure, smart editors can help, and turning on the display of invisibles can help (but at the cost of aesthetics), but it&apos;s never going to be ideal.</p>\n<p>But fundamentally I just don&apos;t care. It&apos;s not worth getting all upset arguing about any of these perspectives because, no matter you do, you&apos;re going to have to deal with code that has mangled whitespace in it. Do your best to play by the rules of the community that you&apos;re in, always try to be consistent, but don&apos;t be obsessive because trying to win the tabs versus spaces debate is like trying to put the genie back in the bottle. It&apos;s entropy.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

The problem is that all your plain Ruby files will now be identified as &quot;Rails&quot;, even when they have nothing to do with Rails (of course, Ruby <em>is</em> much more than just Rails). If you fall into the trap of toggling the language pop-up back to &quot;Ruby&quot; for such a file then you&apos;ve blown it and will have delete your manual language bindings again.</p>\n<p>What&apos;s the ideal solution to this quagmire? Evidently the key piece is a method for choosing between ambiguous options (where <tt>.rb</tt> can be Rails or Ruby). What would be the best way to do this? Writing it to the files resource fork? (not so good on a multi-user system where many different users may edit the same file.) Keeping the type information in per-user, centralized store? (in your <tt>~/Library/Application Support/</tt> directory.) Allowing regular expressions based on the full path of the file, not just its extension? (in other words, matching against paths like <tt>.+/app/models/.+\\.rb</tt>; that&apos;s not the actual regex I would use but this darn wiki markup I&apos;m using doesn&apos;t allow me to type square brackets!)</p>\n\n</div></div>",

Despite the fact that for some time now C has been &quot;the new assembly&quot;, extensions written in C integrate remarkably well with Ruby&apos;s pure garbage-collected, object-oriented goodness.</p>\n<p>I am working on <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Rails\">Rails</a> application at the moment and pretty much <em>all</em> the textual content is going to be entered and stored as <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/wikitext\">wikitext</a>, my favorite free-form markup. I could do the parsing in Ruby but I want this to be <em>fast</em>, so I didn&apos;t even bother prototyping it in Ruby first: I dived straight into C from the beginning, using an <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/ANTLR\">ANTLR</a>-generated lexer (using the C target) and a custom parser/transformer on top of that in hand-coded C.</p>\n<p>The core (Java) target of ANTLR itself uses UTF-16 but the C target uses UTF-16&apos;s obsolete half-brother, UCS-2. Actually, it apparently uses UTF-32 under the covers but the interface it exposes works with UCS-2. The problem with UCS-2 is that it can&apos;t represent all Unicode characters, only a subset of them, because it doesn&apos;t have a surrogate mechanism like UTF-16 does. For precisely this reason it is easier to deal with because you have a guarantee that all characters are exactly 16 bits, but it sucks because it means that there are some valid Unicode input strings that you can&apos;t convert to UCS-2, which in turn means that your ANTLR-generated C recognizer won&apos;t be able to process them. UTF-32 doesn&apos;t have this problem because it is both fixed width <em>and</em> large enough to represent all of the Unicode codepoints, but the down side is that it takes up a little more space (probably not much of an issue with a wikitext parser, where most slabs of input text aren&apos;t ever going to occupy more than a few KB). In any case once the ANTLR C target&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/API\">API</a> settles down into something stable I&apos;ll consider making the switch to UTF-32 if it doesn&apos;t require too much work (or I&apos;ll just throw the whole ANTLR thing out the window and write a scanner using <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ragel\">Ragel</a>).</p>\n<p>But I digress. I wanted to talk about benchmarking.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002821more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>All that stuff about ANTLR was just to background to explain that in my wikitext parser I have to convert from the input encoding (UTF-8) to UCS-2 for internal processing purposes. Then at the end I convert back to UTF-8 and return the results.</p>\n<p>I initially did this with the <a href=\"http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/iconv/rdoc/index.html\">iconv</a> module that comes with the Ruby standard library. Then, seeing as it is relatively simple to convert back and forth between UCS-2 and UTF-8 I decided to write some internal conversion methods in pure C, thus eliminating the dependency on iconv and hopefully being faster to boot. If I ever move to UTF-32 the methods will be easily extended.</p>\n<p>So I just did some benchmarking to compare the results. I basically converted in both directions with both implementations (the custom internal one and the iconv one), and I tried with four different classes of input: short strings with only ASCII characters in them, short strings with non-ASCII characters, big slabs with only ASCII characters, and big slabs with non-ASCII characters.</p>\n<p>Each line in the following tables shows the time taken for 100,000 iterations; the first batch are from the &quot;rehearsal&quot; run and then there&apos;s the &quot;real thing&quot;:</p>\n<pre>Sanity checking: ....\nRehearsal --------------------------------------------------------------------\niconv (short ASCII to UCS-2)       0.490000   0.000000   0.490000 (  0.500046)\ninternal (short ASCII to UCS-2)    0.120000   0.010000   0.130000 (  0.116604)\niconv (short UTF-8 to UCS-2)       0.560000   0.000000   0.560000 (  0.561324)\ninternal (short UTF-8 to UCS-2)    0.130000   0.000000   0.130000 (  0.140209)\niconv (longer ASCII to UCS-2)      9.080000   0.030000   9.110000 (  9.222262)\ninternal (longer ASCII to UCS-2)   1.240000   0.010000   1.250000 (  1.263230)\niconv (longer UTF-8 to UCS-2)     12.940000   0.040000  12.980000 ( 13.131333)\ninternal (longer UTF-8 to UCS-2)   3.480000   0.020000   3.500000 (  3.548404)\niconv (short ASCII to UTF-8)       0.500000   0.000000   0.500000 (  0.503098)\ninternal (short ASCII to UTF-8)    0.130000   0.000000   0.130000 (  0.159429)\niconv (short UTF-8 to UTF-8)       0.560000   0.000000   0.560000 (  0.558365)\ninternal (short UTF-8 to UTF-8)    0.140000   0.000000   0.140000 (  0.148177)\niconv (longer ASCII to UTF-8)      9.150000   0.030000   9.180000 (  9.230961)\ninternal (longer ASCII to UTF-8)   1.520000   0.000000   1.520000 (  1.563547)\niconv (longer UTF-8 to UTF-8)     11.840000   0.040000  11.880000 ( 12.011918)\ninternal (longer UTF-8 to UTF-8)   4.670000   0.010000   4.680000 (  4.722022)\n---------------------------------------------------------- total: 56.740000sec\n\n                                       user     system      total        real\niconv (short ASCII to UCS-2)       0.490000   0.000000   0.490000 (  0.498087)\ninternal (short ASCII to UCS-2)    0.110000   0.000000   0.110000 (  0.117257)\niconv (short UTF-8 to UCS-2)       0.570000   0.000000   0.570000 (  0.570418)\ninternal (short UTF-8 to UCS-2)    0.130000   0.010000   0.140000 (  0.145102)\niconv (longer ASCII to UCS-2)      9.080000   0.020000   9.100000 (  9.217037)\ninternal (longer ASCII to UCS-2)   1.240000   0.010000   1.250000 (  1.264873)\niconv (longer UTF-8 to UCS-2)     12.940000   0.040000  12.980000 ( 13.138847)\ninternal (longer UTF-8 to UCS-2)   3.480000   0.010000   3.490000 (  3.526458)\niconv (short ASCII to UTF-8)       0.500000   0.000000   0.500000 (  0.509422)\ninternal (short ASCII to UTF-8)    0.140000   0.000000   0.140000 (  0.147287)\niconv (short UTF-8 to UTF-8)       0.560000   0.010000   0.570000 (  0.570325)\ninternal (short UTF-8 to UTF-8)    0.150000   0.000000   0.150000 (  0.170726)\niconv (longer ASCII to UTF-8)      9.170000   0.020000   9.190000 (  9.268911)\ninternal (longer ASCII to UTF-8)   1.520000   0.010000   1.530000 (  1.554178)\niconv (longer UTF-8 to UTF-8)     11.840000   0.030000  11.870000 ( 12.044493)\ninternal (longer UTF-8 to UTF-8)   4.670000   0.020000   4.690000 (  4.744175)</pre>\n<p>I was pleasantly surprised at the speed-up.

You said it&apos;d take pages, but even just a short rundown would be interesting.\n<br>Does it make feature branches easier? Does it encourage people to do more refactoring? Just curious to hear someone&apos;s opinion on this.</blockquote>\n<p>I&apos;ll answer this with specific reference to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a> seeing that&apos;s the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/distributed%20version%20control\">distributed version control</a> system with which I have the most experience. Although I could rave on about how Git is the best thing since sliced bread for so many reasons, I&apos;ll try to limit myself specifically to its distributed nature.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002824more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<a name=\"History\"></a><h3>History</h3>\n\n<p>Every &quot;checkout&quot; is actually a full copy of the entire remote repository (all its branches, all its history). After a while you just get used to the idea that you can rapidly look back at any previous tag (previous releases for example) and look at any of the branches that are currently under development (unlike Subversion where the typical workflow is to check out only the tip of the &quot;trunk&quot;). This also means that every checkout is a full backup of <em>everything</em> in the history of a project. And once you&apos;ve done this initial &quot;checkout&quot; (called a &quot;clone&quot; in Git terminology for obvious reasons) you can do all this stuff (look at previous releases, switch branches, explore the history) without any network access.</p>\n<p>Worried about size and speed? Don&apos;t. Git has an extremely efficient network transfer protocol and repository format which makes checkouts comparable in terms of time and space to their Subversion counterparts; you&apos;ll often be surprised to see that an entire Git repository with <em>all</em> the history is as small or smaller than the equivalent Subversion checkout (which is just the tip of the development history).</p>\n<a name=\"Offline%20operations\"></a><h3>Offline operations</h3>\n\n<p>I already touched on this above, but the fact that your local &quot;checkout&quot; is a full-fledged repository means that you can do basically everything without a network connection: commit changes, create branches, perform diffs against any other point in the project history, merge, and so forth. You later make your changes available to the outside world when you are ready.</p>\n<p>The oft-cited example is that you can take your work with you on the road (in a plane with no network connectivity, for example), but you&apos;ll enjoy an enormous benefit in working offline even when you&apos;re in your office with your always-on net connection: the reasons are simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Working offline is <em>fast</em>.</li>\n<li>Working offline provides you with an additional &quot;staging area&quot; (your local, private repository): if you commit something by mistake you can fix it up before anyone else sees it; this in turn means that you can make your history cleaner, keep the &quot;noise&quot; down, and can make your development easier to understand for others (and for yourself when you come back to look at it six months down the track). I use this functionality many times a day; you can fix a spelling error or add a file that you forget about and update the previous commit with <tt>git commit --amend</tt> (the commit message editor is conveniently populated with the original commit message so if you want you can just accept that and exit the editor).</li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"Simplicity\"></a><h3>Simplicity</h3>\n\n<p>Setting up a Git repository is orders of magnitude simpler than setting up a Subversion one. It has to be that way, otherwise all this cloning would be tiresome.</p>\n<pre>cd project\ngit init</pre>\n<p>That&apos;s all you need to set up a repository in the <tt>project</tt> directory. Point your webserver at that directory and you&apos;ve just made a publicly-accessible Git repository that people can reach via HTTP. Copy the repository onto a USB stick and you can take it with you wherever you go. And remember: the thing you&apos;re carrying around on the USB stick isn&apos;t just a working copy, it&apos;s the entire repository with all of its branches and all history.</p>\n<p>You can also publish repositories over the native Git protocol using the <tt>git-daemon</tt> that comes with Git; setting it up is dead simple. This is a very efficient access method if you want to make your repository available to the public. For private repositories SSH access is again dead simple to set up.</p>\n<p>Finally, you need not &quot;publish&quot; your local repository at all if you don&apos;t want. Git provides a <tt>git push</tt> command that you can use to transmit your changes to remote repositories.</p>\n<a name=\"Collaboration\"></a><h3>Collaboration</h3>\n\n<p>This is the point I took special exception with with Collins-Sussman the other day.</p>\n<blockquote>DVCS ... encourages anti-social behavior ... In a nutshell: with a centralized system, people are forced to collaborate and review each other&apos;s work; in a decentralized system, the default behavior is for each developer to privately fork the project. They have to put in some extra effort to share code and organize themselves into some sort of collaborative structure. Yes, I&apos;m aware that a DVCS is able to emulate a centralized system; but defaults matter. The default action is to fork, not to collaborate! This encourages people to crawl into caves and write huge new features, then &quot;dump&quot; these code-bombs on their peers, at which point the code is unreviewable.</blockquote>\n<p>His point is totally bogus. Centralized systems don&apos;t force people to collaborate and review; good policies do. You can work well with others with a centralized <em>or</em> distributed system, just like you can have a terrible community process with a centralized or distributed system.</p>\n<p>The default isn&apos;t to &quot;privately fork&quot; at all. That&apos;s nonsense. The default is to <em>clone</em>, and all that means is that you get a free copy of all the history and branches. At the end of the day the way you interact with &quot;upstream&quot; is still most likely to be <tt>git diff</tt> and sending a patch to the maintainer (although Git actually makes it easier than that by providing you with the <tt>git format-patch</tt> and <tt>git send-email</tt> tools; you can set-up custom per-user or per-repository aliases that make it totally easy to send patches to different projects without having to think about who should be in the &quot;To:&quot; field and who in the &quot;CC:&quot;).</p>\n<p>Putting in extra effort to share code? Collins-Sussman has evidently never seriously tried out a DVCS. Git in particular provides a host of mechanisms that actually make it easier to share code &quot;upstream&quot;.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlike Subversion, Git allows all contributors to be first class citizens. With Subversion you can only commit if you have commit privileges. With Git you can do anything &quot;the maintainer&quot; can do. You can develop your code in small steps, committing along the way, reverting changes if necessary, ensure its correctness, and then when it&apos;s ready for publication prepare a patch series that shows the logical steps you took; this will be much easier to understand than the monolithic &quot;all-at-once&quot; patch that you&apos;d have to send if you were working with Subversion. The people upstream are more likely to accept your change simply because it will be in a more reviewable form, and your code will be of higher quality because your source control system enabled you to work in incremental steps; in fact, you&apos;ll code with more confidence because you know that you make commits along the way which serve as &quot;snapshots&quot; that you can revert to if the ideas that you try out don&apos;t work.</li>\n<li>What do you do if you&apos;re working on a feature in Subversion and by the time you&apos;ve finished it and are ready to submit the tip of the trunk has already moved along? &quot;Your patch doesn&apos;t apply cleanly&quot;, say the maintainers, &quot;Please resubmit.&quot; Git, on the other hand, was designed with collaboration in mind from the outset; it provides the <tt>git rebase</tt> command for precisely this purpose. With Git you can spend a week working on a change, and prior to submitting just do a <tt>git rebase</tt>; Git unwinds your changes, pulls down the changes from upstream, then reapplies your changes on top of the new &quot;tip of trunk&quot;. Once again, your changes are more likely to be accepted because the reviewers don&apos;t have to look at code which was designed to be applied only on last week&apos;s trunk.</li>\n<li>That&apos;s really just scratching the surface: <tt>git rebase</tt> also allows you to re-order your commits before publishing if you want; <tt>git add --interactive</tt> allows you to commit hunks of file instead of the whole thing, thus allowing you to split up unrelated changes into different commits, again facilitating review and increasing the likelihood of acceptance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, if you want to use Git as though it were centralized it&apos;s perfectly easy and natural to do so. Can Collins-Sussman actually cite any projects that are using Git without a central &quot;authoritative&quot; repository that all other developers use as a reference point?</p>\n<a name=\"Flexibility\"></a><h3>Flexibility</h3>\n\n<p>You&apos;re not limited to just cloning &quot;the upstream&quot; repository. Just say you start working on a feature and later learn that someone else is doing related work. You can <tt>git fetch</tt> from that person&apos;s repository into your own (that is, you can pull from multiple different repositories into a single local one) and merge in his or her changes. This is great on large projects where someone works as an integrator or filterer before sending changes upstream.</p>\n<p>Or take what&apos;s happening in the Git community right now: the maintainer, Junio Humano, is away due to unexpected personal circumstances, and so the intermin maintainer, Shawn Pearce, is taking over seamlessly using his own clone of the central repository which Junio controls. When Junio gets back he can simply merge in the patches which Shawn has been collecting, filtering, and ordering. This kind of smooth hand-over of control is much more difficult with a centralized model. If you&apos;re curious, you can see how all of this is happening, because it&apos;s happening out in the open on the Git mailing list.</p>\n<a name=\"Feature%20branches\"></a><h3>Feature branches</h3>\n\n<p>As you alluded to, branching is a big feature of Git, and more importantly, merging (without proper merging the ability to branch is next to useless; even Subversion can branch like a champ, it&apos;s just its merging which sucks).</p>\n<p>Because Git is so good at branching and merging, it&apos;s dead easy to maintain separate &quot;experimental&quot; and &quot;maintenance&quot; branches. But even more so, branching and merging is so easy that you find yourself making feature branches (&quot;topic branches&quot; seems to be the dominant term in the Git community) where you work on a single feature in isolation.</p>\n<p>This keeps your development efforts organized, makes it easier for you to group related changes together for submission upstream, and once again makes it more likely that your patches will be accepted. For the upstream maintainers too, having great branching and merging makes integrating your patches much easier: the maintainer can easily have a bunch of topic branches in his or her repository, one for each topic submitted by a community member. Based on feedback he/she can ask for changes and additional patches from the submitter, add them to that topic branch, and then merge the topic branch in to the main master branch when its ready.</p>\n<p>Branching and merging in Git is about as easy as copying a file.</p>\n<a name=\"Refactoring\"></a><h3>Refactoring</h3>\n\n<p>You asked about refactoring, but I&apos;m not sure that there&apos;s anything specific to the distributed nature of systems like Git that makes a difference here. All you can really say is that the ease with which you can set up topic branches encourages you to engage in experimental refactoring (of the &quot;let&apos;s just try this and see if it looks better&quot; variety).</p>\n<a name=\"Sliced%20bread\"></a><h3>Sliced bread</h3>\n\n<p>I&apos;ve tried to restrict my points above to the aspects in which distributed version control can be superior to centralized systems.</p>\n<p>To finish up I&apos;ll just briefly mention some points about Git that don&apos;t really have anything to do with its distributed nature but which make it a great version control system.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Speed: <em>apart</em> from the fast offline access already mentioned, Git itself is a speed-demon. Most of it is written in lean-and-mean <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/C\">C</a> code, with some high-level user-interface stuff written using scripting languages. This isn&apos;t just a coincidence; from the very beginning it was designed to be quick and it&apos;s one of the things that will most impact you when you try it out.</li>\n<li>Simplicity: repositories use a simple data model (four object types, history represented as a directed acyclic graph) that you can grok with a few minutes of study; this means that you can actually understand how Git works under the covers. </li>\n<li>Robustness: The simplicity makes for fewer bugs and a codebase that you can really trust.</li>\n<li>Maturity: Git&apos;s already at 1.5+ and it shows...</li>\n<li>Innovation: ...but not ready to sit back and rest on its laurels the Git community is blazing ahead with constant innovations (the recently added <tt>git stash</tt>, <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/09/stash.php\">for example</a>).</li>\n<li>Community: The Git community is highly active and has some impressively competent programmers in it. Subscribe to the mailing list and look at what must be one of the most impressive development processes in the open source world. I have learnt a lot from this inspiring community in the last few months and have changed a lot of my own practices for the better.</li>\n<li>Interface: Git is a pleasure to use from the command line (automatic paging, colorized output) but also comes with some excellent cross-platform GUI tools for visualizing history (gitk), preparing commits (git-gui), and web-based repository browsing (gitweb).</li>\n<li>Documentation: There is a wealth of high-quality documentation. Basic use can be learnt in only a few minutes, but if you want to delve deeper there is as much material as you could possibly want. Even if you don&apos;t want to become a Git expert the man pages are a great reference to consult whenever you want to do something out of the ordinary.</li>\n<li>Clean working copies: When you clone a repository everything goes into a single <tt>.git</tt> subdirectory; no more <tt>.svn</tt> metadata littering the entire repository hierarchy and causing problems inside Mac OS X  bundles.</li>\n<li>Philosophy: Git avoids the entire metadata arms race entirely by tracking content and nothing more. In other words, it doesn&apos;t bother trying to remember things like when you renamed one file to another, it merely remembers what the tree looked like before and after. It can look at the tree whenever necessary to infer whether or not a rename occurred. I <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/07/a_look_back_bra.php\">previously tried to explain</a> why this particular design decision was a flash of genius.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>In &quot;Indies Roll the Dice on Final Leopard&quot;, <a href=\"http://stevenf.com/2007/10/indies_roll_the_dice_on_final_leopard.php\">Steven Frank</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>It increasingly looks like we won&apos;t be getting access to the final build of Leopard until the same day our customers do. We have a close-to-final seed, but not the actual shipping bits.<br><br>This isn&apos;t a new thing. It was the same deal with Tiger, and other OS releases before it. Apple has not stated any reason why the final builds are withheld from developers.<br><br>There has been speculation that it&apos;s to prevent prerelease piracy of the OS, but that argument doesn&apos;t hold much water -- in the best possible case, they are simply delaying piracy by about a week. The more likely scenario is that the final build will appear on BitTorrent trackers before it appears on store shelves despite this quaint measure. Such was certainly the case with Tiger.</blockquote>\n<p>Well, I actually think it <em>is</em> to do with piracy. Apple knows that if they seeded a real release candidate, a release candidate which could end up being the GM, it would wind up on trackers a weeks (or weeks) before retail release. Literally tens of thousands would download it, and thousands of those weekend pirates are ultra-enthusiastic <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mac%20OS%20X\">Mac OS X</a> users who would otherwise be in line at the Apple store on 26 October ready to hand over their $129. Apple has proven to be pretty effective at getting Mac OS X torrents taken down at high-profile sites in the past, but no amount of damage control can be perfect.</p>\n<p>So when the stakes are this high (a million dollars&apos; worth of lost sales would be worth worrying about even for an economic behemoth like Apple), you can see the reason they care about pre-release piracy.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, they&apos;re screwing their developers.</p>\n<p>I&apos;ve been a $500-per-year ADC Select member for some time now and one of the benefits is access to pre-release versions of the OS <em>and</em> the final version too (<a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/products/select.html\">note</a> that members &quot;receive shipping versions of Mac OS X and Xcode via mail&quot;).</p>\n<p>Getting the retail version, not on the day your customers can buy it (as Frank mistakenly claims), but weeks after is pretty useless for a developer. Worse still, Apple makes no promises about <em>when</em> they&apos;ll send out the final version. What are your options?</p>\n<p>Forget installing, forget testing, and hope that your customers don&apos;t run into compatibility trouble?</p>\n<p>Install the weeks-old pre-release seed and perform compatibility testing on that, hoping it&apos;s close enough to the final GM to be meaningful? Remember, there are no guarantees that you&apos;ll be able to upgrade such a pre-release install so you&apos;re most likely looking at another clean install down the track.</p>\n<p>Do you drop $129 (in addition to you $500 Select membership) on 26 October in order to get your hands on a copy instead of waiting an indeterminate number of weeks for Apple to mail you one?</p>\n<p>Do you just jump on a pirate torrent as soon as one becomes available (probably sometime on 26 October)? What&apos;s the legality of &quot;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_shifting\">time-shifting</a>&quot; intellectual property that someone has promised to mail to you anyway? If illegal (likely, seeing as in downloading the IP that Apple has promised to give you anyway you&apos;re still uploading pieces of it to other people in the swarm, and that&apos;s &quot;contributory infringement&quot;, I&apos;d imagine), and if you get caught (unlikely), what are the odds of you being prosecuted?</p>\n<p>So yes, it sucks. Yes, complaining to Apple about it is almost certainly useless. Yes, Apple did exactly the same with Tiger. I seem to recall the same was true with Panther although my memory&apos;s a bit hazy on that one now; one thing I do remember is that you couldn&apos;t even buy a retail copy of Mac OS X on release day in Spain. I think I ended up buying my retail copy a few weeks later.</p>\n<a name=\"Update%20(28%20October%202007)\"></a><h3>Update (28 October 2007)</h3>\n\n<p>I <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/news/archives/2007/10/leopard_update.php\">just learned</a> that Apple has made the final version available to developers via download. The date in the downloads listing is shown as 26 October, the same day as the retail release, although I only just found out about it now and I don&apos;t know when it truly became available.</p>\n<p>While this is a pleasant surprise for developers like me who had decided to wait for Apple to deliver a copy as promised in return for their $500 ADC Select membership, and certainly a big improvement over what happened with Tiger, I am sure there a lot of pissed-off developers out there who waited in line at the Apple Store on Friday and handed over $129 for something that they couldn&apos;t possibly have known that Apple was about to make available to them for free (especially considering Apple&apos;s track record).</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002827more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

My initial testing with <tt>US</tt> didn&apos;t force the page into English as desired, but it appears that <tt>GB</tt> does work.

About 2.3 seconds. Guy Meyer, the author, has one of the fairest upgrade policies you&apos;re ever likely to find. My initial purchase was back in January 2004. Now, nearly four years later in October 2007, Guy offers me a 50% upgrade discount on the already very reasonably-priced single user license (currently 7.38&#x20AC; at today&apos;s exchange rates); after tax that makes the upgrade only 4.28&#x20AC;.</p>\n<p>As a customer, I applaud Guy for his fair policy.

In the short time I&apos;ve been using the final version of Leopard I&apos;ve found it to be very, very flaky. Nothing to be too concerned about as this is standard fare for a point-zero Apple OS release; after a few point releases we should see stability getting back to Tiger levels.</p>\n<p>Some examples from only a few hours of use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Machine froze during upgrade install, had to hard reset and do an archive install instead</li>\n<li>Machine froze trying to quit the Disk Utility after performing First Aid after the first hard reset, requiring a second one</li>\n<li>Inability to connect to local AirPort network on startup</li>\n<li>Reproducible Spotlight crashes when typing in search strings like &quot;12 * 3&quot;</li>\n<li>In fact, Spotlight failed to produce an index on the startup disk at all, only ever returning results on the other attached volumes</li>\n<li>Finder refused to hide despite being told to do so repeatedly; finally when hidden refused to come to the front, requiring that I quit it using Activity Monitor</li>\n<li>System Preferences became unresponsive; force quitting has no effect and icon continues in Dock despite the fact that the process no longer appears in the process listing; the same later occurred for Disk Utility (which incidentally froze on launch)</li>\n<li>Doesn&apos;t recognize Pioneer DVR-K06 optical drive installed after the Apple-supplied unit flaked out</li>\n<li>Crash reports can&apos;t be sent to Apple, windows perpetually stuck at &quot;Sending&quot; phase</li>\n<li>Asked what I wanted to do with inserted DVD when nothing had been inserted</li>\n<li>Failed to respond to keyboard and mouse input on waking from screensaver; was necessary to unplug and plug back in keyboard in order to get a response</li>\n<li>Apple applications that have crashed include Spotlight (multiple times), System Preferences and Mail</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, I can see myself instigating an always-reboot policy every morning and perhaps every afternoon too just to keep this thing running in a non-degraded state. Very much looking forward to 10.5.1 and its siblings; they can&apos;t come soon enough.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002857more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

No doubt this is ridiculously easy with Mac OS X Server, but in the non-server version it&apos;s far from obvious.</p>\n<p>The NetInfo Manager utility has finally be laid to rest, but so have <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/command%20line\">command line</a> tools like <tt>adduser</tt>. The <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> file starts with this info:</p>\n<pre>##\n# User Database\n# \n# Note that this file is consulted directly only when the system is running\n# in single-user mode.  At other times this information is provided by\n# Open Directory.\n#\n# This file will not be consulted for authentication unless the BSD local node\n# is enabled via /Applications/Utilities/Directory Utility.app\n# \n# See the DirectoryService(8) man page for additional information about\n# Open Directory.\n##</pre>\n<p>So what am I supposed to do? Use the Directory Utility application to turn on the BSD local node and then manually edit <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> and set a password using the <tt>passwd</tt> tool (for which there is no longer a manpage, but at least <tt>password --foo</tt> causes usage information to be printed)? Is there a more elegant way than this?

Don&apos;t people find <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Rails\">Rails</a> apps hard enough to deploy already? They want to add yet another incredibly bloated and complex dependency?</p>\n<p>I looked into learning Java many years ago when it looked like it was going to be the next big thing. I developed an immediate distate for its needlessly prolix syntax and tiresomely lengthy class and method naming conventions. But it&apos;s not just the low level aesthetics which bug me; it&apos;s the high-level obsession with &quot;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns\">design patterns</a>&quot; which starts to really grate on my nerves. While no one would argue that a modest tool kit of &quot;patterns&quot; aren&apos;t helpful (<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Cocoa\">Cocoa</a> uses <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/MVC\">MVC</a>, delegate, singleton and observer patterns highly effectively, for instance), I find this all-encompassing fascination with myriad over-theorized patterns a silly distraction.</p>\n<p>A shame because Java apparently had a lot of things going for it, even a cool name.</p>\n<p>But in my experience whenever I&apos;ve had to get my hands dirty with Java as a developer it&apos;s been a thoroughly disagreeable experience. Even in the upgrade to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard\">Leopard</a> I&apos;ve already run into at least one very ugly Java-related problem (this one relating to Ant; someone&apos;s plan to make Makefiles even worse by turning them into hideous, convoluted XML). And in my end-user (non-developer) brushes with Java I&apos;ve found the applications to be enormous resource hogs, bloated, and ugly to boot. There are good Java apps out there that work very well (Azureus, for example) but a native implementation would literally blow it away (I have a copy running right now which has nearly <em>70</em> threads running when basically idling).</p>\n<p>The right solution is making Ruby itself faster, and that&apos;s already being done.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002899more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

I discussed this with Matz and Koichi, and it is great to hear that they are positive about this effort. The objective wouldn&apos;t be to rewrite Ruby again, neither to brutally fork the code base, but to work with the Ruby core team and try to figure out a nice integration. I will write more about this soon.</blockquote>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002904more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

I started things going and went out, and when I came back the installation had finished and the machine had rebooted but it was totally blocked with a spinning beachball, so I had to hard reset it.</p>\n<p>I rebooted from the installation disk and ran Disk First Aid, which reported literally hundreds of errors (laughable old HFS+). After the Disk First Aid run I was able to provoke another beachball just by clicking on the Apple menu. So that was my second hard reset.</p>\n<p>So, another Disk First Aid run, this time without errors, and another installation, this time opting for an in-place upgrade install seeing as the previous attempt (an archive install) hadn&apos;t worked out. I don&apos;t really like in-place upgrades for major releases, preferring a clean install as an opportunity for some spring cleaning, but such is life. So lost about 90 minutes all up.</p>\n<p>Several days later came my third hard reset under Leopard, this time brought on by Leopard&apos;s lack of support for my Pioneer DVR-K06 drive (a replacement I installed because the Apple-supplied drive flaked out after only a year of use). This was an issue which cropped up in a number of forms in the seed builds and which I had hoped would be resolved in final, but alas, it was not to be.</p>\n<p>Ironically, Leopard obviously <em>can</em> support the drive (I installed Leopard from it!) but it doesn&apos;t work in practice. Basically, the System Profiler reports that there is no burner installed most of the time, but the other day I thought I&apos;d stick in a disc and see what happened and much to my surprise it actually mounted the contained volume!</p>\n<p>Alas, trying to copy a file from it resulted in a Finder hang (beachballing) after only 4 MB. I tried firing up the Disk Utility but that hang too, and in a cascade effect more and more applications hung or refused to launch until the machine became totally useless. Luckily I had a Terminal window still open so I was able to issue a <tt>sudo reboot</tt>, but that ended up being useless too (infinite spinner) and I had to hard reset. So from here on I&apos;ll have to boot back into Tiger whenever I want to read from or write to an optical disc.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002907more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<a name=\"Involuntary%20reboot%20stats%20to%20date\"></a><h3>Involuntary reboot stats to date</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Operating system version:</strong> 10.5</li>\n<li><strong>Kernel panics:</strong> 6</li>\n<li><strong>Hard resets:</strong> 13</li>\n<li><strong>Total failures:</strong> 19</li>\n<li><strong>Start of recording keeping:</strong> 21 May 2006</li>\n<li><strong>Total days to date:</strong> 539 days</li>\n<li><strong>Average time between failures:</strong> 28.36 days</li>\n<li><strong>Uptime at moment of failure(s):</strong> various</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div></div>",

Possibly without mail too. Probably wouldn&apos;t be a bad thing.</p>\n<p>After rebooting, dancing the merry Disk First Aid jig, and rebooting again, my copy of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mail.app\">Mail.app</a> wouldn&apos;t start up. Basically, it would beachball permanently on startup using almost zero CPU. Samples taken with Activity Monitor showed some kind of thread deadlock, all threads blocking in either <tt>__semwait_signal</tt> (most threads) or <tt>mach_msg_trap</tt> (in the thread running the main runloop).</p>\n<p>So something was hosed. I used <tt>lsof</tt> to get the list of open files, looking for corruption. One of the frames in the stack trace was <tt>handleSqliteError</tt>, but the only obvious SQLite database that was open was <tt>~/Library/PubSub/Database/Database.sqlite3</tt> and it looked to be fine.</p>\n<p>So I restored my <tt>~/Library/Mail</tt> folder from a backup; it was only a few hours old (I backup obsessively, from a cron-job run every 6 hours; this machine has proven so unreliable that mere daily backups would amount to reckless foolhardiness) so only lost a small quantity of mail, hopefully none of it important. I&apos;m seriously thinking about doubling the number of back-up runs (to once every three hours). This is getting ridiculous.</p>\n<p>But on relaunching Mail.app I saw the &quot;first run&quot; wizard and a number of my preferences had been reset. Most notably, there were no RSS feeds configured at all. That would have been the end of RSS for me forever, as there was no way I was going to reconfigure all those feeds. Luckily, copying over the <tt>~/Library/Mail/RSS</tt> folder from the old (corrupt) version seems to have worked. I&apos;m my very own human Time Machine, it would seem. I have no idea why the <tt>RSS</tt> folder was absent from the backup copy.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a002909more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

So after a bit of juggling around with the help of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SuperDuper!\">SuperDuper!</a>, I&apos;ve now got:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a minimal <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Tiger\">Tiger</a> install on the small (20 GB) partition that I previously used for backups (I&apos;ll keep this around because at the moment Leopard doesn&apos;t properly support my Pioneer DVR-K06 burner)</li>\n<li>a full daily backup of my Leopard startup volume to another partition, courtesy of SuperDuper!</li>\n<li>the old seed partition, 60 GB, for other backups</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the past I was doing compressed, automated backups of my home directory 4 times a day (every 6 hours), to the partition onto which I&apos;ve just installed Tiger. Now I&apos;ve got 3 times as much space, so I&apos;m going to do the backups 12 times a day (every 2 hours) instead. This is approaching the hard limit for the number of backups I could theoretically do in a day, given that each backup run currently takes about 1 hour 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>Do you think this is going too far? Personally, given the track record of this machine, it seems perfectly reasonable; losing even a couple of hours&apos; work is painful. And given that the backups run at a <tt>nice</tt> level of 20 the performance impact should be negligible. Now I have bootable, daily snapshots of my entire startup volume, <em>and</em> two-hourly snapshots of the data which changes most often (my home directory). Additional layers of protection are afforded by storing copies of my source code in off-site <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a> repositories and running my machine here off a nice <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/UPS\">UPS</a>. My old custom of burning a copy of my home directory to DVD-R once per day for added security will remain on hold until Apple starts supporting my burner adequately in Leopard.</p>\n<p>This is really about as far as I can go right now; when Apple rolls out read/write, bootable <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/ZFS\">ZFS</a> I&apos;ll be able to remove another weak link in the chain (the joke HFS+ filesystem; does the &quot;H&quot; stand for &quot;Hilarious&quot;? I wonder who&apos;s laughing). The next logical step would then be upgrading to a Mac Pro (still on the lowly iMac here) so that I can pack in multiple disks and start benefitting from <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/RAID-Z\">RAID-Z</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a003092more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

In my initial experiments with it I quickly realized that I had to think in an app-centric way rather than a task-specific way. Basically, you need to keep all windows belonging to a particular app in the same space or your application switcher behaviour will be at best counter-intuitive and at worst a nuisance.<br><br>And that means that I&apos;ve yet to find a real use for Spaces because my work pattern tends to be task or project-oriented rather than app oriented (eg. a Terminal window showing the source folder of a particular project, the accompanying Xcode windows, perhaps a Finder window showing the build folder etc). When you work this way Spaces doesn&apos;t really help you because you can&apos;t have one project per space. It seems suited only to completely unrelated tasks which use entirely different apps, and in my workflows there are all too few tasks that you can think of in total isolation like that.</blockquote>\n<p>Two weeks later of full-time <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard\">Leopard</a> use and I still haven&apos;t found a use for spaces.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a003111more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

In fact, I didn&apos;t actually <em>know</em> it wasn&apos;t compatible until I went to the Shirt Pocket website in search of an explanation as to why my &quot;Smart Updates&quot; weren&apos;t so &quot;Smart&quot; anymore (basically, instead of copying across only new and modified files, each backup resulted in basically <em>all</em> files being copied across again).</p>\n<p>So there are glitches but it &quot;works&quot; in a limited way (no crashes, the backup actually completes, but I haven&apos;t tested to see if the backup is bootable and I guess it&apos;s likely that it won&apos;t be). I guess a suspicious backup is better than no backup at all.</p>\n<p>Now that I know that full support isn&apos;t there I&apos;ll unschedule my daily SuperDuper! run and wait for the update. Looks like Shirt Pocket wasn&apos;t too happy about Apple not letting their $500-a-year ADC Select members get their hands on the final version of Leopard until <em>after</em> the retail customers did; but Shirt Pocket is not alone in that sentiment.</p>\n<p>Although it would have been nice if Apple had provided developers with the GM for final testing, at least they were a little quicker this time around than they were with Tiger.

Christ, it must suck giant wet donkey balls to be stuck on an archaic OS where you need to be dropping into the terminal and tweaking configuration files and compiling shit all the time.</blockquote> \n<p>Can you guess the &quot;archaic&quot; OS that Pilgrim is <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/11/11/installing-mysql-on-ubuntu\">talking about</a>? None other than <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard\">Leopard</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>I hope the translucent menu bar is worth it.</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, pretty much.</p>\n<p>The article itself is mostly troll but there is one seed of truth underneath it all: <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/MySQL\">MySQL</a> <em>is</em> unnecessarily hard to install on Leopard. Of course, it&apos;s still not that hard. This should be enough:</p>\n<pre># from inside the source tree\n./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql &amp;&amp;\nmake test &amp;&amp;\nsudo make install</pre>\n<p>In other words basically the exact same steps that work for any open source project out there. MySQL will hopefully update their binary installers soon so that even that much <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/commandline\">commandline</a> interaction can be dispensed with.</p>\n<p>But in short, Pilgrim is exaggerating and most of his complaints are total non-issues; why?</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a003193more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>Firstly, there are multiple package managers for Mac OS X. I choose not to use any of them because I actually like the control afforded to me by micromanaging it myself. For the amount of such software that I install it&apos;s really not a significant effort.</p>\n<p>The security issues might be a concern if you run a server on the public Internet, but I&apos;m a Mac OS X desktop user and my machine is behind a firewall. If I was running a Mac OS X Server out in the wild I&apos;d already have MySQL installed, updated and security patched automatically for me by Apple.</p>\n<p>The launch-at-startup behaviour is a non-issue too. We&apos;re talking about desktop machines here, not always-on servers. Automatically launching MySQL at startup is easily enough done, and it will be easier with the binary installer, but why would you want to do it?</p>\n<p>I&apos;ll bet that most people installing MySQL on their Mac OS X desktop machines are <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Rails\">Rails</a> developers (or similar) who want to do local testing. For such people starting up is a simple matter of <tt>sudo -b mysqld_safe</tt> at the start of their development session. Launching at startup is a waste of time; do you really think that those people are connected to their MySQL database from the very first minute that they power up their machine? Do these same people auto-launch everything in their Applications folder every time they log in &quot;just in case&quot; they need it later on?</p>\n<p>And those horrendous ADC terms and conditions. Every copy of Mac OS X comes with the Xcode Tools so Pilgrim&apos;s complaint is irrelevant; membership is not required nor is submitting your personal information to Apple.</p>\n<p>Strip away all of Pilgrim&apos;s strawmen arguments and all you&apos;re left with is a dusty, hollow husk of an argument. The post does have a kind of irreverent sarcasm that borders on entertaining, but I can&apos;t help but wonder if taking the time to reply to it has really been the wisest investment.</p>\n<p>Ah well. At least I have my translucent menu bar.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>There is an <a href=\"http://marc.info/?l=git&amp;m=119637184605851&amp;w=2\">interesting thread</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a> mailing list going on right now which demonstrates exactly what it is that Git gets right about modelling history.</p>\n<p>Basically, it doesn&apos;t worry about storing metadata about file renames, file moves, file copies and the like, which is a mistake which almost every other <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SCM\">SCM</a> makes. Git only cares about whole trees, and which commits where parents of which commits; it&apos;s this chaining of commits from child to parent (to grandparent...) which allows Git to model the notion of &quot;history&quot; and things like <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/branching\">branching</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/merging\">merging</a> (two or more commits which have the same parent obviously indicate where a branch was forked, and a commit with two or more parents is where a merge took place).</p>\n<p>The model is rock solid and infallible because it is simple.</p>\n<p>Git <em>does</em> do fancy file rename and copy detection, but it deduces it merely by looking at the commit graph. It doesn&apos;t need any metadata to be stored. This is exactly the way it should be done. If you store metadata, you&apos;re locking yourself into the best algorithms you had at the time of storage; if you forget metadata and instead deduce you can always use the very best algorithms available at the time you examine the history.</p>\n<p>This is not just a theoretical benefit. The <a href=\"http://marc.info/?l=git&amp;m=119637184605851&amp;w=2\">thread I&apos;m linking to</a> is a great example of algorithmic improvements being made which increase Git&apos;s accuracy and sophistication without requiring repositories to be rebuilt and metadata to be re-calculated and re-stored.</p>\n<p>As Torvalds sums up in <a href=\"http://marc.info/?l=git&amp;m=119638337122721&amp;w=2\">this post</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>The thing to take away from this is:\n<ul>\n<li>git really doesn&apos;t even <em>care</em> about the whole &quot;rename detection&quot; internally, and any commits you have done with renames are totally independent of the heuristics we then use to <em>show</em> the renames.</li>\n<li>the rename detection really is for just two reasons:<ul>\n<li>keep humans happy, and keep the diffs small and</li>\n<li>help automatic merging across renames. So getting renames right is certainly good, but it&apos;s more of a &quot;politeness&quot; issue than a &quot;correctness&quot; issue, although the merge portion of it does matter a lot sometimes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>the important thing here is that you can commit your changes and not worry about them being somehow &quot;corrupted&quot; by lack of rename detection, even if you commit them with a version of git that doesn&apos;t do rename detection the way you expected it. The rename detection is an &quot;after-the-fact&quot; thing, not something that actually gets saved in the repository, which is why we can change the heuristics <em>after</em> seeing examples, and the examples magically correct themselves!</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<div id=\"a003200more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

You &quot;feature freeze&quot; and focus only on fixing bugs &#x2014; in fact, making non-bugfix changes should be prohibited &#x2014; and when you think they&apos;re all squashed you put out a release candidate.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you need more than one candidate because bugs are discovered during this part of the cycle, but you&apos;re <em>still</em> effectively in &quot;feature freeze&quot; and that means no more features. Furthermore, the bug fixes you <em>do</em> check in should be minimal, safe, conservative, well-tested, non-invasive. Frivolous refactoring is a no-no at this point.</p>\n<p>Well, with that concept in mind, take a look at <a href=\"http://dev.rubyonrails.org/timeline?from=12%2F7%2F07&amp;daysback=7&amp;milestone=on&amp;changeset=on&amp;update=Update\">the repository activity</a> for <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Rails\">Rails</a> in the last 7 days leading up to the final 2.0 release (which was very quickly followed up with a 2.0.1 release). Maybe I am jumping the gun (I haven&apos;t looked over every changeset in between RC1, RC2 and the final release) but I get the impression that there is <em>way</em> to much going on here right before release.</p>\n<p>All of this stuff is occurring right on the trunk during the &quot;release candidate&quot; phase immediately prior to the final release of a much-anticipated and widely-used web framework which markets itself as enterprise-ready. I know that the Rails folks, known as much for their marketing as for their technical nous, have made it &quot;cool&quot; to &quot;live on the edge&quot;, but this really is ridiculous. I know <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion\">Subversion</a> sucks for branching and merging, but they need to get their code into a non-broken <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/SCM\">SCM</a> like <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a>, start making use of at least two branches (one for mainline development and one for maintenance), start cooking invasive changes in topic branches, and adopt some discipline in their approach to releases, especially major ones. </p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a003264more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

This commit is an initial version of the application which loads the prefPane bundle and displays the window in the center of the screen on launch.</p>\n\n<p>This change was made after a review of the Garbage Collection migration. Synergy&apos;s code is found in two places: inside the application itself and inside the preference pane (and the application is bundled inside the preference pane bundle). The application code has been converted to use Garbage Collection but the preference pane code could not be converted because the System Preferences application is compiled without GC support and the PreferencePanes framework against which the preference pane must link does not come in a GC-enabled version, at least as of Leopard.</p>\n\n<p>This is problematic because some of the Synergy code is shared between the app and the preference pane; it is therefore necessary for the common code to be written using a reference-counting style (which largely negates the benefit of moving to GC) or using conditional compilation to produce two variants of the same code (which is an error-prone process).</p>\n\n<p>So evaluating all this, it seems the best course of action is to host the preference pane in a standalone application. In order to do so I can no longer link against the PreferencePanes framework, so I&apos;ve made a new class, WOPreferencePane, to stand in for NSPreferencePane, and a simple NSWindow subclass, WOPreferenceWindow, to load and display a single pane.</p>\n\n<p>An additional benefit of this move is that from now on Synergy will not require an installer because as a standalone application it can be installed anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Signed-off-by: Wincent Colaiuta &lt;win@wincent.com&gt; </p>",

    "html": "<p>When I got home my machine, which had been up for about a day and had a bunch of in-progress work in open applications, started acting funny. New Terminal windows were totally blank (neither the command prompt nor any other text would ever appear), suggesting some kind of problem with the Directory Services infrastructure which is used on <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard\">Leopard</a> for user authentication. Strangely, everything else seemed to be working fine; I could open and close windows, launch applications, and write to files with no problems. (Sometimes you see situations in which you can&apos;t do those things; in those cases it seems that the cause must be some kind of resource exhaustion, like running out of Mach ports due to a leak.)</p>\n<p>So I decided to reboot and went off to have a shower. On getting back I was looking at a blank desktop (no  menu bar, no Dock, no icons) with only a spinning indicator. It seems that the posited Directory Services problem was impeding the shutdown. No choice but to pull the plug. Ugh.</p>\n<p>You know, basically since switching to <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mac%20OS%20X\">Mac OS X</a> I&apos;ve had about a one-month average time between involuntary reboots. At first this seemed pretty awesome, having come from OS 9; but now after half a decade it&apos;s starting to get pretty old. One-month time-to-failure doesn&apos;t seem so impressive any more. If I were running Linux or FreeBSD then I&apos;m sure that my time-to-failure would be measured in years rather than days, and determined by hardware rather than software; in other words, my involuntary reboots would happen every couple of years when a drive had a physical failure, rather than every month. I still remember a beloved FreeBSD box I used to have at home which was up for 400 days once before a power failure in the neighbourhood finally brought it down (back in the days before I had a UPS).</p>\n<p>So it seems that this is the price of all the eye candy and the polished user experience. I am starting to get a little weary of paying it. But no, I&apos;m not actually thinking of switching away from Mac OS X: I&apos;m just wishing that Apple would devote a few more resources to core stability and robustness rather than so much superficial candy.</p>\n<a name=\"Involuntary%20reboot%20stats%20to%20date\"></a><h3>Involuntary reboot stats to date</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Operating system version:</strong> 10.5.1</li>\n<li><strong>Kernel panics:</strong> 6</li>\n<li><strong>Hard resets:</strong> 16</li>\n<li><strong>Total failures:</strong> 22</li>\n<li><strong>Start of recording keeping:</strong> 21 May 2006</li>\n<li><strong>Total days to date:</strong> 579 days</li>\n<li><strong>Average time between failures:</strong> 26.32 days</li>\n<li><strong>Uptime at moment of failure(s):</strong> roughly 24 hours</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div id=\"a003315more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>I&apos;ve always been a little confused by <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Apple\">Apple</a>&apos;s &quot;<a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPRuntimeConfig/Articles/PListKeys.html\">Property List Key Reference</a>&quot;. It seemed that the documented purpose of some of the property list keys deviated from the actual behaviour of the OS, especial in relation with the display of version numbers in the Finder.</p>\n<p>The documentation seems to have undergone a number of <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPRuntimeConfig/RevisionHistory.html\">revisions</a> lately (&quot;Undocumented the CFBundleGetInfoString key&quot;, &quot;Added details on the new purpose of the CFBundleGetInfoString key&quot;, &quot;Reintroduced the CFBundleGetInfoString key&quot;) and this is the current state of affairs under <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard\">Leopard</a>:</p>\n<a name=\"Behaviour\"></a><h2>Behaviour</h2>\n\n<p>This is really the only thing you need to care about.</p>\n<p>The value of <tt>CFBundleGetInfoString</tt> is shown in Finder &quot;Get Info&quot; window. An appropriate value for this   key might be something like &quot;MyApplication 1.2 (332), Copyright 2007 Me&quot;; in other words, the application name, the release version, the build number, and the copyright info. This key can be localized.</p>\n<p>A string consisting of &quot;<tt>CFBundleShortVersionString (CFBundleVersion)</tt>&quot; is shown in your application  &quot;About&quot; box. A typical value for <tt>CFBundleShortVersionString</tt> would be something like &quot;Version 1.2&quot;. This key can and often is localized, principally because of the presence of the word &quot;Version&quot;. The <tt>CFBundleVersion</tt> is usually a build number, like &quot;332&quot; in the example above. There&apos;s no reason to localize this and in fact Apple&apos;s docs say that the key isn&apos;t localizable.</p>\n<p>The <tt>NSHumanReadableCopyright</tt> key is used to provide a localized copyright notice which appears under the version number in the standard Cocoa About box (thanks to Jean-Daniel Dupas for pointing this out to me).</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a003357more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<a name=\"The%20docs\"></a><h2>The docs</h2>\n\n<p>So what do the docs say? It seems that of late the behaviour, at least in Leopard, and the documentation match up a lot better than they used to.</p>\n<a name=\"%3Ctt%3ECFBundleGetInfoString%3C%2Ftt%3E%3A%20a%20%26quot%3BBrief%20description%20of%20the%20bundle%26quot%3B\"></a><h3><tt>CFBundleGetInfoString</tt>: a &quot;Brief description of the bundle&quot;</h3>\n\n<blockquote>This key identifies a brief description of the bundle. For an application bundle, this key provides a short description of the application or the current release that the build or release version number cannot convey; for example, the date of the release. This key can be localized.</blockquote>\n<a name=\"%3Ctt%3ECFBundleVersion%3C%2Ftt%3E%3A%20%26quot%3BThe%20build-version-number%20string%20for%20the%20bundle%26quot%3B\"></a><h3><tt>CFBundleVersion</tt>: &quot;The build-version-number string for the bundle&quot;</h3>\n\n<blockquote>This key specifies the build version number of the bundle, which identifies an iteration (released or unreleased) of the bundle. This is a monotonically increased string, comprised of one or more period-separated integers. This key is not localizable.</blockquote>\n<a name=\"%3Ctt%3ECFBundleShortVersionString%3C%2Ftt%3E%3A%20%26quot%3BThe%20release-version-number%20string%20for%20the%20bundle%26quot%3B\"></a><h3><tt>CFBundleShortVersionString</tt>: &quot;The release-version-number string for the bundle&quot;</h3>\n\n<blockquote>This key specifies the release version number of the bundle, which identifies a released iteration of the application. The release version number is a string comprised of three period-separated integers. The first integer represents major revisions to the application, such as revisions that implement new features or major changes. The second integer denotes revisions that implement less prominent features. The third integer represents maintenance releases. The value for this key differs from the value for &quot;CFBundleVersion&quot;, which identifies an iteration (released or unreleased) of the application.</blockquote>\n<a name=\"%3Ctt%3ENSHumanReadableCopyright%3C%2Ftt%3E%3A%20%26quot%3BSpecifies%20the%20copyright%20notice%20for%20the%20bundle%26quot%3B\"></a><h3><tt>NSHumanReadableCopyright</tt>: &quot;Specifies the copyright notice for the bundle&quot;</h3>\n\n<p>Finally it&apos;s worth mentioning this one:</p>\n<blockquote>This key contains a string with the copyright notice for the bundle; for example, &quot;&#xFFFD; 2006, My Company&quot;. You can load this string and display it in an About dialog box. This key can be localized by including it in your InfoPlist.strings files. This key replaces the obsolete CFBundleGetInfoString key.</blockquote>\n<p>More information can be found in the documentation for the <tt> orderFrontStandardAboutPanelWithOptions:</tt> method in <tt>NSApplication</tt>:</p>\n<blockquote>...this method then looks for the value of NSHumanReadableCopyright in the localized version infoDictionary.</blockquote>\n<a name=\"Conclusion\"></a><h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>So there you have it. The docs make it very clear that your build numbers should be &quot;monotonically increasing strings&quot; comprising &quot;one or more period-separated integers&quot;. Great if you use <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Subversion\">Subversion</a>-based build numbers; you&apos;ll need to ignore those rules if your build numbers are actually SHA-1 hashes (based on <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Git\">Git</a> commits, for example). Likewise your release versions are supposed to be of the form &quot;x.y.z&quot;; bad luck if you want to do &quot;1.0-rc1&quot; or &quot;2.1b3&quot; and the like, but it seems unlikely that any harm will come from not following these rules (or are they guidelines?) to their fullest.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

I am beginning to fear that NSAppleScript can&apos;t be used at all in a garbage collected environment.</p>\n\n<p>As a defensive tactic I&apos;m updating all invocations of the method to pass NULL for the error dictionary. This usage is not documented, but it does follow a pattern employed by many other Apple APIs and there are plenty of examples of code out there in the wild that do use this pattern.</p>\n\n<p>So basically this is a &quot;try it and see&quot; change to see if it eliminates the sporadic crashes. If it doesn&apos;t then more drastic measures will be required, most likely involving the replacement of NSAppleScript with something else (the scripting bridge, for example).</p>\n\n<p>Signed-off-by: Wincent Colaiuta &lt;win@wincent.com&gt; </p>",

The last release, version 3.2, was <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard\">Leopard</a>-compatible but would also run on all versions of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mac%20OS%20X\">Mac OS X</a> from <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Jaguar\">Jaguar</a> onwards.</p>\n<p>The 3.5 series, on the other hand, is a total rewrite in Objective-C 2.0 which will run <em>only</em> on Leopard and as such it is somewhat experimental in nature. If you want stability then I recommend that you stick with 3.2 for now, but if you like to live on the edge and see the latest then by all means try out the 3.5 series. This new alpha fixes a large number of issues reported for the previous alpha and should prove to be much more polished.  There are still some minor issues being investigated, but this is now much closer to what the final 3.5 release will look like.</p>\n<p>A full changelog appears <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/history/#3.5a3\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>You can download the new release <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/download.php?item=SynergyBeta.zip\">from here</a> and purchase a license using <a href=\"https://secure.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/purchase/\">this page</a>. The 3.2 series can still be downloaded <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/download.php?item=SynergyJaguar.dmg\">from here</a>. Once the 3.5 series goes final it will be a free upgrade to all users who have purchased a license for Synergy 3.0 or higher (that is, if you purchased on or after 5 September 2006 then 3.5 will be a free upgrade for you).</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a003489more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>I&apos;m pleased to announce the availability of version 3.5a4 of <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com\">Synergy</a>, the fourth alpha release in the brand new 3.5 series. The last release, version 3.2, was <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard\">Leopard</a>-compatible but would also run on all versions of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mac%20OS%20X\">Mac OS X</a> from <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Jaguar\">Jaguar</a> onwards.</p>\n<p>The 3.5 series, on the other hand, is a total rewrite in Objective-C 2.0 which will run <em>only</em> on Leopard and as such it is somewhat experimental in nature. If you want stability then I recommend that you stick with 3.2 for now, but if you like to live on the edge and see the latest then by all means try out the 3.5 series. This new alpha fixes a large number of issues reported for the previous alpha and should prove to be much more polished.  There are still some minor issues being investigated, but this is now much closer to what the final 3.5 release will look like.</p>\n<p>A full changelog appears <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/history/#3.5a4\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>You can download the new release <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/download.php?item=SynergyBeta.zip\">from here</a> and purchase a license using <a href=\"https://secure.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/purchase/\">this page</a>. The 3.2 series can still be downloaded <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/download.php?item=SynergyJaguar.dmg\">from here</a>. Once the 3.5 series goes final it will be a free upgrade to all users who have purchased a license for Synergy 3.0 or higher (that is, if you purchased on or after 5 September 2006 then 3.5 will be a free upgrade for you).</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a003499more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>Looking at <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/131461/2008/01/macproupdate.html\">the specs</a> on the new Mac Pros, nice to see the &quot;grunt&quot; factor rolling inexorably forward.</p>\n<blockquote>The new Mac Pro combines two of Intel&#x2019;s new 45 nanometer Quad-Core Xeon 5400 processors running up to 3.2 GHz, new graphics and up to 4TB of internal storage. The Mac Pro features 12MB of L2 cache per processor, dual-independent 1600 MHz front side buses and up to 32GB of 800 MHz DDR2 ECC FB-DIMM memory. According to Apple, the new Mac Pro achieves a 61 percent increase in memory throughput. The systems also include a new PCI Express 2.0 graphics slot that delivers up to double the bandwidth compared to the previous generation, the company said.</blockquote>\n<p>Up to this point, all good. But from that point on it starts to get into science fiction territory:</p>\n<blockquote>With the new PCI Express, the Mac Pro supports the latest generation of graphics cards from NVIDIA, such as the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT with 512MB of video memory, or the NVIDIA Quadro FX 5600 with 1.5GB of video memory and a 3D stereo port for stereo-in-a-window applications.</blockquote>\n<p><em>1.5 Gigabytes of video memory</em>? That&apos;s almost as much main memory as I have on this iMac (where I have 2GB). But that&apos;s not the end of it... This last sentence is just <em>insane</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>With support for up to four graphics cards, the new Mac Pro can drive up to eight 30-inch displays at once for advanced visualization and large display walls.</blockquote>\n<p>Hard to imagine that number of pixels. Up til now performance gains in Apple&apos;s pro lines have always been something desirable. This goes beyond desirable into the &quot;couldn&apos;t possibly take advantage of this capability in a million years&quot; zone, at least for me.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a003539more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

However our goal is to be able to have it available for the next OS X release and sooner if we can.</blockquote>\n<p>So will we get it in a 10.5 point release?

    "html": "<p>This replaces the original behaviour of the scroller (rectangular scroll knob, triangular buttons) with better-looking controls which match those seen in Interface Builder (rounded rectangle scroll knob, circular buttons).</p>\n\n<p>In order to pull this off I&apos;ve had to override the rectForPart: method. I originally investigated compensating for Cocoa&apos;s many, many quirks (for example, when the user has their preferences set to show the arrows separately there is an overlap of two pixels with the scroll knob, but if their preferences are set to show the arrows together then there is no overlap but there is a 4-pixel band of unused space at the other end of the scroll slot; buttons are non-square, the up/down and left/right pairs aren&apos;t necessarily the same size, and worse, their shape changes depending on the preferences; there are many, many other irregularities that I won&apos;t describe here).</p>\n\n<p>In the end I decided that making adjustments for Cocoa&apos;s idiosyncrasies was too brittle and could break with any OS update, and so what I&apos;ve done in the end is basically completely rewrite the rectForPart: method and do all of the geometry calculations from scratch, sans idiosyncrasies. Evidently the Interface Builer team also wrote their own from scratch, or at least it seems so, because their scrollers do not obey the user preference for displaying the arrows together.</p>\n\n<p>There is still more to do: there is a minor visual smear when moving the vertical scrollbar (I think this may be due to a rounding issue), and at the moment I haven&apos;t yet added the arrows inside the circular buttons.</p>\n\n<p>Signed-off-by: Wincent Colaiuta &lt;win@wincent.com&gt; </p>",

Even a beginner can rename large batches of files in mere seconds.</p>\n<p>Powerful because through Regular Expressions (the &quot;RE&quot; in REnamer) it allows you to transform your filenames in complex ways with a minimum of effort.</p>\n<p>Elegant because its thoughtful design combines all this into an attractive, uncluttered and expressive interface which shows you a live preview of what changes will be made to your filesystem.</p>\n<p>Please head on over to the <a href=\"http://renamer.wincent.com/\">product page</a> and check out the sneak preview screencast which shows a small part of REnamer in action. Sign up to the beta testing mailing list while you&apos;re there too.</p>\n<p>I&apos;m currently planning on releasing a public beta at the beginning of February, with a view to releasing version 1.0 by the middle of the month.

I don&apos;t have a firm date for the migration yet, and I need to do quite a bit of research before then about the best way to get all my data across. This will basically be a clean install on a new hard drive, the server should only be down for a relatively short interval, and then we&apos;ll come back on line and over the following hours I&apos;ll be transferring user accounts, mail, databases, software and everything else from the old hard drive to the new. So it will be quite intense, and most services <em>will</em> be interrupted for at least some of the migration. I expect to be transferring and configuring for several hours, possibly even the entire day.</p>\n<p>One way to minimize the interruption would be to install the drive with the new system on it and migrate some of the data before rebooting, but I&apos;m not sure how much time that will actually buy me, nor whether my host, <a href=\"http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=30735717&amp;siteid=41506187&amp;bfpage=hosting_headaches\">Rackspace</a>, would be prepared to do that (it would require them to install RHEL 5 on the drive in another machine, then uninstall it from that machine and reinstall it into mine).</p>\n<p>I&apos;m very happy about this because it means I will be able to gradually retire bits of legacy software and replace all of this with a single, lean, unified <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Rails\">Rails</a> application which handles everything for me (bug tracking, customer support tracking, forums, the wiki, and so forth).</p>\n<p>Deploying Rails is a bitch by all accounts, but it&apos;s easier on RHEL 5 than it is on RHEL 3, (specifically, there are fewer pieces of additional software that you have to install, and you deviate less from the supported, auto-updated configuration). And once you&apos;ve deployed it you&apos;ve got <em>one</em> application stack to worry about instead of half a dozen.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a003708more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>I&apos;m pleased to announce the availability of version 3.5a5 of <a href=\"http://synergy.wincent.com\">Synergy</a>, the fifth alpha release in the brand new 3.5 series. The last release, version 3.2, was <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Leopard\">Leopard</a>-compatible but would also run on all versions of <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Mac%20OS%20X\">Mac OS X</a> from <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Jaguar\">Jaguar</a> onwards.</p>\n<p>The 3.5 series, on the other hand, is a total rewrite in Objective-C 2.0 which will run <em>only</em> on Leopard and as such it is somewhat experimental in nature. If you want stability then I recommend that you stick with 3.2 for now, but if you like to live on the edge and see the latest then by all means try out the 3.5 series. This release fixes some minor issues found in the last alpha; the sporadic crashes caused by using <tt>NSAppleScript</tt> under Garbage Collection are still being investigated.</p>\n<p>A full changelog appears <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/history/#3.5a5\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>You can download the new release <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/download.php?item=SynergyBeta.zip\">from here</a> and purchase a license using <a href=\"https://secure.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/purchase/\">this page</a>. The 3.2 series can still be downloaded <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/download.php?item=SynergyJaguar.dmg\">from here</a>. Once the 3.5 series goes final it will be a free upgrade to all users who have purchased a license for Synergy 3.0 or higher (that is, if you purchased on or after 5 September 2006 then 3.5 will be a free upgrade for you).</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a003759more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

RAM is very important for performance when compiling code in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Xcode\">Xcode</a>, mostly due to the amount of memory occupied by precompiled headers.</p>\n<p>The top-end model would be a big improvement over my current machine &#x2014; a 2.7 GHz Core 2 Extreme with 2 gig of RAM and a bigger screen (24&quot; up from 17&quot;) and hard drive (500 GB up from 160 GB) &#x2014; but it&apos;s out of my price range at 2,159&#x20AC;.</p>\n<p>So really my only two options at this stage are to cross my fingers and hope that this machine holds up, or send it in for repair; and with the deadlines I have looming I just can&apos;t afford to be without this machine, even for a few days.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a003774more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>I&apos;m a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Rails\">Rails</a> dabbler who has never actually deployed an application yet but has been working in spare moments on a new version of this site that will be powered by Rails.</p>\n<p>I was puzzled today to see excess <tt>SELECT</tt> queries whenever I saved a record. The queries were for attributes that were entirely unrelated to what I was manipulating.</p>\n<p>I&apos;ll spare you the long story and cut to the chase. It turns out that these extra queries are generated by <tt>validates_uniqueness_of</tt>. I guess I should have known. The entire model gets validated whenever you save, even attributes that you haven&apos;t touched. I guess this makes sense.</p>\n<p>Now, I am not really sure about the point of <tt>validates_uniqueness_of</tt> because it is vulnerable to a classic race condition; basically Rails checks &quot;is this unique?&quot; and if it is goes ahead and saves the record. Of course, in a multi-user application it&apos;s possible that what was unique a millisecond again is no longer so.</p>\n<p>Basically <tt>validates_uniqueness_of</tt> can&apos;t provide you with any guarantees, and if that&apos;s the case then why bother using it? I had it in my app mostly for experimentation purposes.</p>\n<p>The only robust way to approach this is to do what we always do when we have race conditions to worry about: go ahead and save the record and only if it doesn&apos;t work worry about what you&apos;ll do. In order for this to work you need to impose a database-level constraint which will cause an exception to be thrown if someone tries to create a duplicate (and of course, the database won&apos;t permit the creation of the duplicate to succeed).</p>\n<p>Something like this in a migration should do it:</p>\n<pre>add_index :things, :attribute, :unique =&gt; true</pre>\n<p>Try to insert a &quot;thing&quot; with a duplicate &quot;attribute&quot; and MySQL will complain about a &quot;Duplicate entry&quot; and Rails will duly raise an <tt>ActiveRecord::ActiveRecordError</tt> which you can rescue and deal with appropriately.</p>\n<p>If you&apos;re doing that then is there any point in keeping those <tt>validates_uniqueness_of</tt> calls? Perhaps. I guess if the probability of races is low then you can keep your application logic simpler by relying on <tt>validates_uniqueness_of</tt> for informing the user nicely that &quot;that name is already taken&quot;, and rely on database-level constraints to handle the really nasty race conditions (and throw an irrecoverable error). I suppose it depends on how much traffic and contention you&apos;re expecting. If traffic is high and performance is a real issue then you might just want to get rid of the validation; it doesn&apos;t provide any guarantees and those extra queries will only slow you down.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a003775more\"><div id=\"more\">\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>I wrote the other day that I was going to be <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2008/01/moving_to_rhel.php\">moving to RHEL 5</a> in the near future. What I wasn&apos;t sure at the time was exactly <em>how</em> I&apos;d be making the move. At the time it seemed that the most likely pathway was going to be installing a new drive for RHEL 5 and migrating the data over afterwards; the exact mechanics of this were never really defined (would the drive have RHEL 5 <em>pre</em>-installed on it prior to being slotted in? would they need to take the machine down and do the install &quot;in place&quot;?).</p>\n<p><em>Ideally</em> my host (<a href=\"http://rackspace.com/\">Rackspace</a>) would have slotted in a drive with a pre-installed OS on it, brought the server online so I could migrate my data over to the new drive and <em>then</em> rebooted from the new drive. I thought they use identical, standard hardware configurations to allow precisely this kind of thing.</p>\n<p>So you&apos;d be looking at two reboots, one of them accompanied by a few minutes of downtime to physically install the drive, and then a period in which some services didn&apos;t work properly because they&apos;d need to be tweaked, set-up and configured only after booting into RHEL 5 for the first time. But overall impact to your website visitors would be fairly minimal. Once all that was done you&apos;d be looking at another quick powercycle while they shut down the server to remove the old drive (you don&apos;t get anything for free from Rackspace).</p>\n<p>I wonder how often Rackspace does this type of upgrade. As it was, they were suprisingly slow to offer the details of the procedure and offer options, and that&apos;s what makes me wonder.</p>\n<p>After quite a bit of deep thought I decided that instead of staying with Rackspace I&apos;d move on to another company. I&apos;ve chosen <a href=\"http://inetu.net/\">INetU</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a003819more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>Moving hosts is always a risky move. I originally went to Rackspace because all of the evidence I&apos;d seen suggested that they were the very best; if I switched to them I&apos;d never need to switch away again. But now I&apos;ve been with them for 2.5 years I&apos;ve experienced both the good and the bad of Rackspace. The &quot;good&quot; is pretty good, and the &quot;bad&quot; isn&apos;t all that bad, but I don&apos;t think they can really compete with INetU&apos;s offering and that&apos;s why I&apos;m risking the switch.</p>\n<a name=\"The%20good\"></a><h3>The good</h3>\n\n<p>Rackspace has a great network. They have a great track record, with the exception of <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/business/2007/11/rackspace-data-.html\">the big data center incident last year</a>. I know some people decided to leave Rackspace because of that incident; personally, for me that&apos;s not the reason I&apos;m leaving. I know that even the best companies can make mistakes occasionally and I trust that Rackspace has learned their lesson.</p>\n<p>Their support is indeed &quot;fanatical&quot; most of the time, if you measure it in terms of response time. For example, whenever I needed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework\">SPF</a> records added to my domain names I could open a ticket and expect that the records would be updated promptly; most often in only a few minutes.</p>\n<p>Likewise they have automated server monitoring in place and if a service stops responding they log in, investigate and fix it if possible. In general it seems they responded within a few minutes to such alerts and had solved the problem a few minutes later.</p>\n<a name=\"The%20average\"></a><h3>The average</h3>\n\n<p>However, I don&apos;t think the support is &quot;fanatical&quot; as it really could be. Response time is important but it is not the be-all-and-end-all. The &quot;solution&quot; to these alerts usually just meant restarting Apache. No attempt at identifying the real cause was ever made. When they did offer a cursory diagnosis it was wrong; I am not a professional system administrator but I was able to investigate and determine the real cause without too much effort.</p>\n<p>It seems that their goal is to just close tickets as quickly as possible, but when you&apos;re paying several hundred dollars per month for managed hosting I expect a little better than that. We&apos;re not talking about bugs in third-party software or bizarre non-standard configurations; we&apos;re talking about the kinds of problems which can crop up in any bog-standard Linux box.</p>\n<a name=\"The%20bad\"></a><h3>The bad</h3>\n\n<p>So why were my Apache processes dying every week or month? It turns out that the load was getting too high during the daily backup and the server was unable to handle all the incoming connections. It didn&apos;t happen every day or even every week, but when the backup coincided with enough load from other sources it was enough to make Apache temporarily unavailable to new connections, including the Rackspace monitoring service.</p>\n<p>Turning off the backup is not an option, so the real problem here is that the machine is underpowered.</p>\n<p>And this is where being with Rackspace starts to feel uncomfortable. Let me explain. According to Rackspace, the monthly fee is for a &quot;solution&quot; which includes the hardware and the support. The &quot;solution&quot; does not include up-to-date hardware, it includes only the hardware that was provided when you first signed the contract. After 2.5 years the value-for-money (performance-per-dollar) of the supplied hardware starts to look worse and worse. If the hardware included in your &quot;solution&quot; doesn&apos;t do what you need it to do then you must upgrade to new hardware at your own expense. The set-up fees and ongoing monthly costs for these hardware upgrades are utterly exorbitant.</p>\n<p>As an example, I was quoted a $75 setup fee to install a 250 GB hard drive, and an ongoing fee of $50/month for the pleasure of using the new drive. Note that this is not an additional drive; that price is for removing the old 80 GB drive and replacing it with the larger one. This is ridiculous: the average price for a 250 GB SATA drive is now about $90, yet Rackspace would like to charge me $600 per year for the privilege of having one.</p>\n<p>And you have to wonder why they even offered me this as an option when I said I wanted to upgrade to RHEL 5. I don&apos;t come close to using even half of the 80 GB drive I already have, so why would I want to upgrade to a larger one? When they make this kind of unattractive offer that addresses a problem the customer doesn&apos;t even have (lack of diskspace) it makes them seem totally out of touch with their customers&apos; needs.</p>\n<p>Let me indulge in another example. Another way of getting to RHEL 5 that they offered me was to set up a completely new server. I&apos;d have to pay a $200 setup fee as well as $60 per month more than I am already paying (the new server would have a larger harddrive and a  marginally faster processor than I have now, but it would still have the same amount of RAM &#x2014; 1 GB &#x2014; which is arguably the most important resource a web/database server can have). I just can&apos;t see the value for money in this offer.</p>\n<a name=\"INetU\"></a><h3>INetU</h3>\n\n<p>In comparison, what can INetU offer? I went to them and explained what my concerns with Rackspace were: in a nutshell, that you get locked in to aging hardware and an aging OS (in my case they provided me with RHEL 3 even though RHEL 4 was already out), and if you want to break out of that jail cell you can only do so at considerable expense. They don&apos;t seem to reward customer loyalty and being an ongoing client over a period of years.</p>\n<p>INetU is a much smaller company than Rackspace and my current perception of them (still currently an outsider) is that they try harder. They describe their managed support level as similar or better than Rackspace&apos;s &quot;intensive&quot; support level (at Rackspace I was merely a &quot;normal&quot; customer, not an &quot;intensive&quot; one). My experience with their sales representatives was very positive. Basically they worked with me to iron out a contract that addressed all my needs and concerns. I got the impression that they were trying to provide me with a solution that was truly satisfactory to me rather than just getting me to sign a contract as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>I did give Rackspace a chance. I told them what INetU was offering and said that I didn&apos;t want to leave Rackspace, that I&apos;d much rather continue with Rackspace if they could just address my concerns about hardware and OS lock-in. But all they could offer me were $90 hard drives for $600/year and no ongoing solution to the lock-in problem.</p>\n<p>So I&apos;m off to INetU. Dollar-for-dollar, they offer beefier hardware and more IP addresses than Rackspace, they promise better support (which I&apos;ll be able to report on when I officially become a customer of theirs; so far all the communication has been excellent), and they provide exactly the kind of hardware upgrade path that I was looking for. Basically, they understand that when a customer pays several hundred dollars per month for a &quot;solution&quot;, they want that solution to include up-to-date hardware. I&apos;m not talking about CPU upgrades every six months; I&apos;m just saying that every three years it&apos;s most definitely time to migrate to a new box, and you shouldn&apos;t be penalized for doing that kind of migration. Instead, they should recognize your loyalty and help you to make the move.</p>\n<p>In the case of INetU they can set up a new server for you, put it online, and let you keep the old one online for 30 days while you migrate the data over. When you&apos;re ready you flip the switch. Effectively it amounts to a free month every three years, and a means of keeping your hardware up-to-date without incurring excessive expense and downtime. This is the way it should be. I believe this because for me &quot;premium solution&quot; actually really means &quot;premium, up-to-date solution, today and tomorrow&quot;. This offer may not last forever, but I got it in writing because I explicitly asked for it, and it&apos;s basically <em>the</em> reason I&apos;m moving. It&apos;s a nice way to start the relationship, with INetU specifically tailoring a solution that addresses my concerns.</p>\n<p>So hopefully, this time really <em>will</em> be the last time I move hosting companies. The Rackspace server will be up until the end of February and the INetU one will be coming on line in the last week of February. I&apos;ll have five days of overlap in which to migrate all the data across before pointing the DNS at the new servers. As such, actual downtime will be zero &#x2014; there&apos;ll be none at all &#x2014; and there will probably be a day or two of hiccups where creases need to be ironed out on the new box (it is a new OS, after all).</p>\n<a name=\"Update%3A%2013%20February\"></a><h3>Update: 13 February</h3>\n\n<p>Rackspace got in touch with me one last time to see if there was anything they could do to retain my business. It&apos;s a bit late for that seeing as I&apos;ve already signed a new contract, but they did offer to keep my server online for an extra thirty days at no extra cost, just in case I have problems with my new host and decide to run back into Rackspace&apos;s open arms.</p>\n<p>I don&apos;t anticipate having any problems with INetU, but I think this is nice gesture on the part of Rackspace. I&apos;ve accepted their offer. A little bit of extra insurance never goes astray.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

    "html": "<p>One of my projects is a <a href=\"http://git.wincent.com/wikitext.git\">fast wikitext-to-HTML translator</a>. It&apos;s a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby\">Ruby</a> extension written in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/C\">C</a> with speed being one of its top design goals (robustness, predictability and security being the others). I&apos;m working on this because the <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Rails\">Rails</a> rewrite of this site will use <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/wikitext%20markup\">wikitext markup</a> for basically everything. Rails has a bad reputation for being slow and resource hungry, and that&apos;s why one of my primary objectives is speed; I don&apos;t want my wikitext parser being a bottleneck.</p>\n<p>The translator itself consists of a <a href=\"http://git.wincent.com/wikitext.git?a=blob;f=ext/wikitext.c;h=59eab1da4da6c799ab148c4131d31e8d77c82d5e;hb=HEAD\">hand-coded parser written in C</a> paired with a scanner/tokenizer/lexer generated from a <a href=\"http://git.wincent.com/wikitext.git?a=blob;f=ext/Wikitext.g;h=77bc2cc72a65d601843fc759d279a687b3daca81;hb=HEAD\">grammar specification</a>.</p>\n<p>Up until now the scanner used a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/ANTLR\">ANTLR</a>-generated lexer using the &quot;C target&quot; (although ANTLR itself is written in Java, it can target multiple languages, including C). The C target is the current speed king among ANTLR targets and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. It too is engineered with speed in mind and is quite frugal with resources (for example, when emitting tokens it maintains pointers into the input stream rather than making a copy of the substring for each token).</p>\n<p>And the results were quite snappy. But for some time I&apos;ve had the sneaking suspicion that a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ragel\">Ragel</a>-generated scanner would be faster. I suspected this even though ANTLR uses all sorts of clever tricks like trying to predict which path to take and only backtracking if prediction fails.</p>\n<p>You see, Ragel generates simple state machines: the building blocks of regular expressions. Whereas ANTLR is like a complex and unpredictable magic clock, Ragel state machines are totally transparent and predictable. I&apos;ve spent many months trying to use ANTLR on a number of different projects and in every case <em>except</em> for this wikitext translator I&apos;ve ended up putting it aside because I couldn&apos;t divine the incantations required to make it do its black magic. Ragel, on the other hand, is absurdly simple. You can build complex things out of it, but the base components are easily comprehensible. Compared to ANTLR, Ragel is incredibly easy to learn.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a003874more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<a name=\"Why%20Ragel%20should%20be%20better\"></a><h3>Why Ragel should be better</h3>\n\n<p>So I suspected that Ragel might be a bit quicker. No amount of prediction in a predictive lexer can beat a pure state machine, which by definition is going to run in constant time because it simultaneously explores all possible paths. When you add backtracking into the mix (as a result of trying to always favor the longest match) then you lose your constant time but it should still be fast because the state machines themselves are so efficient.</p>\n<p>One of Ragel&apos;s key advantages is that there is absolutely zero internal function call overhead. This is because the <em>are</em> no internal function calls; everything is done with basic <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/C\">C</a> control structures (<tt>for</tt> loops, <tt>gotos</tt>, <tt>case</tt> statements and the like). Once you&apos;re in the Ragel machine you can stay there until you&apos;ve scanned all the text.</p>\n<p>Another advantage is that it&apos;s trivial to do everything in <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/UTF-8\">UTF-8</a> using Ragel. <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/ANTLR\">ANTLR</a> is a <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Java\">Java</a> tool and so it uses <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/UTF-16\">UTF-16</a>, which means twice the memory most of the time. The C target makes the unfortunate decision of using the obsolete <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/UCS-2\">UCS-2</a> encoding (basically the same as UTF-16 but without surrogates which means that it can&apos;t  represent all Unicode codepoints and is no longer recommended for use) because that&apos;s what maps most easily onto UTF-16. I looked at overriding it to use some other encoding but it looked non-trivial and error prone, and likely to break with every new ANTLR release.</p>\n<p>Using UTF-8 with Ragel, on the other hand, should be much more memory efficient. 99% of all input is going to belong to the ASCII subset of UTF-8 anyway, which means that in most situations we&apos;ll be using exactly half the memory to process our text. We&apos;ll also be avoiding cumbersome and wasteful conversions back and forth between UCS-2 and UTF-8 (all input you get from <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby\">Ruby</a>/<a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Rails\">Rails</a> is going to be in UTF-8). When we do need to go beyond ASCII it should still be relatively quick. We&apos;ll take only a small speed hit because the kind of trivial bit-shuffling required to deal with multi-byte UTF-8 characters is exceedingly fast on modern CPUs.</p>\n<p>And apart from performance I think I just wanted to use a tool that I actually understood, and that had a fathomable, deterministic relationship between the grammar you fed in and the recognizer you got out from the other end. And when I say &quot;fathomable&quot;, I mean &quot;possible to be understood by a mere user rather than only the author of the generator himself!&quot;. So I was tempted to switch to Ragel even if the performance gains where minimal or even non-existent.</p>\n<p>Let me give one quick example of how ANTLR can be a difficult beast to tame. Consider this rule for recognizing <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/URI\">URI</a> tokens:</p>\n<pre>URI : HTTP URI_CHARS (SPECIAL_URI_CHARS URI_CHARS)*;</pre>\n<p>This basically says you want to recognize as a URI a sequence that looks like &quot;http&quot;, following by a bunch of &quot;URI chars&quot; (things like letters, numbers, and so on). And you also want to include &quot;special URI chars&quot; (things like the period) <em>provided</em> that they are followed by more &quot;URI chars&quot;.</p>\n<p>This is what allows you to correctly tokenize sentences like the following:</p>\n<blockquote>My website is <a href=\"http://www.wincent.com/\">http://www.wincent.com/</a>.</blockquote>\n<p>You <em>don&apos;t</em> want that last period to be included in the URI when you turn it into a hyperlink, but you <em>do</em> want the first period to be included because it&apos;s followed by &quot;com&quot;.</p>\n<p>Well, it turns out that the above rule won&apos;t work in ANTLR. Upon seeing &quot;<tt>SPECIAL_URI_CHARS</tt>&quot; it will try to be clever &#x2014; <em>too</em> clever in this case &#x2014; and predicts that what it is about to scan is in fact &quot;<tt>SPECIAL_URI_CHARS</tt> followed by <tt>URI_CHARS</tt>&quot;. If you feed in a text like the above ANTLR will throw a recognition exception because its prediction turns out to be incorrect.</p>\n<p>So you have to write the rule like this using a predicate:</p>\n<pre>URI : HTTP URI_CHARS ((SPECIAL_URI_CHARS URI_CHARS)=&gt; (SPECIAL_URI_CHARS URI_CHARS))*;</pre>\n<p>That last bit says, &quot;recognize <tt>SPECIAL_URI_CHARS</tt> followed by <tt>URI_CHARS</tt>, but only if you&apos;ve first checked to see that there really are <tt>SPECIAL_URI_CHARS</tt> followed by <tt>URI_CHARS</tt>&quot;. In other words, ANTLR scans ahead, and then goes back and rescans the same piece of text again.</p>\n<p>It would be nice if you could use ANTLR without having to know these little tricks. But even if you are fortunate enough to know them, you&apos;re still in a less than desirable position; backtracking in the event of a failed match is expensive, but this kind of backtracking and <em>re</em>-scanning in the case of a successful match seems just plain wrong.</p>\n<p>Now let&apos;s look at the equivalent rule in Ragel:</p>\n<pre>uri = http uri_chars (special_uri_chars uri_chars)* ;</pre>\n<p>I think that speaks for itself, but I&apos;ll make an additional comment anyway. You can look at such a rule and know <em>exactly</em> what kind of state machine it maps to. Entirely predictable, and no black magic or fancy prediction logic under the hood.</p>\n<a name=\"The%20numbers\"></a><h3>The numbers</h3>\n\n<p>The initial numbers are in and I couldn&apos;t be happier. Ragel has exceeded my wildest expectations.</p>\n<pre>                                user     system      total        real\nshort slab of ASCII text    0.180000   0.000000   0.180000 (  0.182539)\nshort slab of UTF-8 text    0.320000   0.000000   0.320000 (  0.330065)\nlonger slab of ASCII text   2.740000   0.000000   2.740000 (  2.792006)\nlonger slab of UTF-8 text   5.000000   0.000000   5.000000 (  5.072432)</pre>\n<p>Each line corresponds to tokenizing a string 100,000 times. The ASCII examples are pure ASCII and represent the &quot;best case&quot; scenario for the scanner while the UTF-8 ones are for a &quot;worst case&quot; one in which the input text is swelled by 34-46% by multibyte characters.</p>\n<p>If you look at the slow-down caused as you add more and more multi-byte characters you see it grow proportional to the number of additional bytes. That is: you&apos;re looking at a basically constant cost per-byte, regardless of the composition of the input.</p>\n<p>So what are we seeing here? 8.24 seconds to tokenize 352 megabytes of input text, which equates to roughly 42.72 megabytes per second on my lowly iMac with its 1.86 GHz Intel Core Duo.</p>\n<p>Here&apos;s the <a href=\"http://git.wincent.com/wikitext.git?a=blob;f=experimental/wikitext_ragel.rl;h=5ab1e2787129acac1d8706fcd53047a4fffd242f;hb=refs/heads/ragel\">initial version</a> of the Ragel scanner (although it may have evolved somewhat by the time you read this). As you can see, moving to Ragel comes at a small cost: you&apos;re running much &quot;closer to the metal&quot; and concerning yourself with pointers and token structures and the like. In a sense this is one of the things I most like about Ragel; I can actually see what it&apos;s doing and control it in every aspect: it&apos;s enigma-free.</p>\n<p>But the cost brings a benefit too. Check out the corresponding numbers for the ANTLR scanner:</p>\n<pre>                                user     system      total        real\nshort slab of ASCII text    9.400000   1.870000  11.270000 ( 11.308913)\nshort slab of UTF-8 text    8.620000   1.880000  10.500000 ( 10.551956)\nlonger slab of ASCII text 132.380000  19.690000 152.070000 (153.296844)\nlonger slab of UTF-8 text 116.280000  19.510000 135.790000 (136.788652)</pre>\n<p>As you can see, Ragel wipes the floor with it. While ANTLR doesn&apos;t suffer any speed hit at all when you start using multibyte characters, its absolute processing speed is nearly 38 times slower than that of Ragel. It tokenizes the same input text at a rate of about 1.14 megabytes per second. That sounds pretty good, until you compare it to Ragel&apos;s 42+ megabytes per second.</p>\n<p>A side note: when I originally published this article I reported figures for Ragel that showed it was &quot;only&quot; 10 times faster than ANTLR; turning on fast goto-driven FSM with the <tt>-G2</tt> switch (as opposed to the default table-driven one) yielded a basically four-fold increase in speed. Now this really starts to get into the &quot;mind-boggling&quot; zone, how Ragel can produce scanners <em>so</em> much faster than the equivalent lexers in ANTLR&apos;s fastest target language. Can internal function call overhead explain such a large gap?</p>\n<p>To be fair to ANTLR, not all of the time in the benchmark is spent inside the ANTLR lexer itself; some of it is spent converting the input from UTF-8 to UCS-2 before feeding it in to the lexer. Seeing as we&apos;re only testing how fast the lexer can spit out tokens, we let it off we don&apos;t worry about converting back to UTF-8 at the end (in the real, non-benchmark scenario, that <em>is</em> a penalty that we&apos;d have to pay).</p>\n<p>Is it fair to penalize the ANTLR lexer in this way? I think so; it <em>is</em> asking for UCS-2 input after all, so if that&apos;s what it wants...</p>\n<p>And to put things in perspective, 10% or less of the time in those numbers is due to the encoding conversion. As I said above, modern CPUs are well suited to doing the basic bit-shuffling required to convert to and from UTF-8, and the benchmark is using a hand-coded converter that I wrote in C.</p>\n<p>The following table shows the performance of the custom converter (prefixed with <tt>internal</tt>) on the same type and quantity of input. The lines prefixed with <tt>iconv</tt> are for the same conversion, but done using the Iconv library which comes with Ruby. As you can see the internal coding converter is much, much faster, and is really only responsible for a tiny portion of ANTLR&apos;s performance problem:</p>\n<pre>                                           user     system      total        real\niconv    (short ASCII to UCS-2)        0.520000   0.010000   0.530000 (  0.531411)\niconv    (short non-ASCII to UCS-2)    0.590000   0.000000   0.590000 (  0.585507)\niconv    (longer ASCII to UCS-2)      10.770000   0.020000  10.790000 ( 11.009323)\niconv    (longer non-ASCII to UCS-2)  14.570000   0.030000  14.600000 ( 14.710083)\ninternal (short ASCII to UCS-2)        0.110000   0.000000   0.110000 (  0.106386)\ninternal (short non-ASCII to UCS-2)    0.150000   0.000000   0.150000 (  0.147468)\ninternal (longer ASCII to UCS-2)       1.300000   0.000000   1.300000 (  1.309406)\ninternal (longer non-ASCII to UCS-2)   3.700000   0.010000   3.710000 (  3.717417)\niconv    (short ASCII to UTF-8)        0.520000   0.000000   0.520000 (  0.544404)\niconv    (short non-ASCII to UTF-8)    0.580000   0.000000   0.580000 (  0.592008)\niconv    (longer ASCII to UTF-8)      11.810000   0.010000  11.820000 ( 11.858008)\niconv    (longer non-ASCII to UTF-8)  14.840000   0.020000  14.860000 ( 14.909430)\ninternal (short ASCII to UTF-8)        0.130000   0.000000   0.130000 (  0.133868)\ninternal (short non-ASCII to UTF-8)    0.180000   0.000000   0.180000 (  0.179611)\ninternal (longer ASCII to UTF-8)       2.550000   0.010000   2.560000 (  2.586608)\ninternal (longer non-ASCII to UTF-8)   5.280000   0.010000   5.290000 (  5.327419)</pre>\n<a name=\"Future\"></a><h3>Future</h3>\n\n<p>The exciting part is that this is only the beginning.

    "html": "<p>Things have been quiet here of late because I&apos;ve been feverishly trying to get things ready in order for the server move coming up at the end of this month. It&apos;s a big move because it&apos;s not just moving the box from one place to another; I&apos;m changing data centers, hosting companies, operating systems, and application software all at once, and there is a <em>lot</em> of work to be done.</p>\n<p>One of the things I&apos;ll be doing is replacing the teetering stack of disparate applications that I&apos;m currently running (a mix of applications &#x2014; Movable Type, UBB.threads, Mailman, Bugzilla, MediaWiki and a number of custom scripts &#x2014;  written in a mix of languages &#x2014; Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby) with a single unified application, a custom job written in Ruby and built on Rails.</p>\n<p>I&apos;m taking the opportunity to greatly simplify things in the &quot;Web 2.0&quot; spirit (ugh, how I hate that term; but I&apos;ve started to use it because it&apos;s lost some of its ridiculous hype feel and has now come to mean a set of widely understood characteristics). And it&apos;s actually quite a liberating experience. Each chunk of code that I delete makes me feel lighter, freer.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"a004101more\"><div id=\"more\">\n<p>Take an example, the wiki. I&apos;m not aiming to write a Ruby on Rails port of MediaWiki. I&apos;m aiming to write a basic wiki that does the same things as MediaWiki did for me, in other words a subset of its functionality. I was able to put that together in about a day (the hard part was writing the wikitext-to-HTML translator, that took weeks). And at the end of it I realized that there were some features of MediaWiki that I&apos;d implemented only because I didn&apos;t think about what I really needed, I just implemented them because &quot;that&apos;s the way wikis are&quot;. Here I&apos;m specifically referring to things like keeping revision history for each article. I realized that I don&apos;t need it; this is a hand-coded wiki built exactly to my specifications, it is not a community-driven wiki and it&apos;s not one where I need to guard against the possibility of vandalism. The entire revision machinery got deleted and I felt great about it. Less code means less lines in which bugs can hide.</p>\n<p>A similar thing happened with respect to the localization system. It was one of the first things I developed. It was elegant. But then I realized that I didn&apos;t need it. Out it went. There as no sense in building in the ability to localize the application &quot;just in case&quot;. And doing localization well isn&apos;t easy. If it can&apos;t be done perfectly then I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any sense in doing it at all. I mean, I could take an English string like:</p>\n<blockquote>The requested %s could not be found.</blockquote>\n<p>Where the &quot;thing&quot; might be &quot;resource&quot;, or &quot;page&quot;, or &quot;bug report&quot;. Whatever. I had machinery for translating that into Spanish:</p>\n<blockquote>No se ha encontrado el %s solicitado.</blockquote>\n<p>The trouble is that &quot;page&quot; in Spanish is feminine, while &quot;resource&quot; is masculine. You can&apos;t just drop in a different word without also changing the surrounding words to match its gender.</p>\n<p>So I could have a simple but imperfect localization system which I might use one day, or I could write a massively complex and flexible system that handled all the thorny edge cases but at a cost of speed and complexity, or I could just rip out the localization system entirely and worry about it when and if I decided I ever needed it. I opted for the latter.</p>\n<p>In the case of the weblog, I got it up and running and then added comments support. Then I realized that I don&apos;t necessarily want comments on my weblog. I&apos;ve never used them before and I shouldn&apos;t start using them now just because that&apos;s what everyone else does. I&apos;m not really interested in holding conversations with random strangers, in public, <em>and</em> hosting it on my own server. I didn&apos;t actually rip out the support for comments because I can imagine posts in which I <em>will</em> want to solicit comments, but I did turn comments off by default.</p>\n<p>Same for the issue tracker: Bugzilla is horrendously powerful, but a lot of users found it scary. I just threw out the ability to define custom statuses (things like &quot;CLOSED (WORKSFORME)&quot;) which I had mindlessly replicated because that&apos;s what I was used to from Bugzilla. No. Think about what you actually need and then write the tool that gives you <em>exactly</em> that, nothing more. For me that&apos;s the whole point of Rails. It&apos;s supposed to make it easy to quickly implement your ideas. Take advantage of that characteristic to write lean custom apps that do what you ask them to, rather than always trying to write the ultimate in reusable, flexible, generalizable code.</p>\n\n</div></div>",

Without the volatile keyword the compiler will see that the pointer is initialized and then never used again and is free to optimize it away to nothing, which then allows Ruby to go ahead and free the structure before its time. The volatile keyword here prevents this optimization, at least in GCC, and is apparently an &quot;accepted hack&quot; that is used in the Ruby source itself.</p>\n\n<p>Signed-off-by: Wincent Colaiuta &lt;win@wincent.com&gt;</p>",

    "html": "<p>This isn&apos;t so much a benchmark as a test, but I don&apos;t want to include it in the specs directory because it is such a long-running script.</p>\n\n<p>The basic idea is to parse a large slab of text 100,000 times and make sure that there is no resource leakage even when exiting abnormally from the parse method.</p>\n\n<p>You can&apos;t really test this within a spec because the spec suite doesn&apos;t run for long enough for resource leaks to really manifest themselves (on my humble machine the spec suite of 564 examples runs in under a third of a second). I could bloat the spec suite to make it run for longer, but that would slow down development and detecting resource leaks from within the specs wouldn&apos;t be all that straightforward anyway.</p>\n\n<p>So the idea is that you run this invalid_encoding script and watch memory usage while it processes the same slab 100,000 times over. The slab is long enough that the parser is fully exercised (things like indentation, various syntax etc), and only at the end do we introduce some invalidly encoded UTF-8 which causes the parse to derail.</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s important to do these long-running tests because when I was initially figuring out how to use Data_Wrap_Struct (before I knew about the need to use the volatile keyword) I was seeing the full spec suite passing, but crashes when running the long-running benchmarks. This was because Ruby&apos;s GC was never being triggered during the spec run and so the problem never manifested itself.</p>\n\n<p>On my machine this script reports 2.55MB RSIZE, 18.53MB VSIZE, 1.66MB private and 820KB shared, and those figures don&apos;t budge at all during the entire run.</p>\n\n<p>Signed-off-by: Wincent Colaiuta &lt;win@wincent.com&gt;</p>",
