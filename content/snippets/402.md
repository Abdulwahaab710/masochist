Currently creating a small static website using [Haml](/wiki/Haml), [Sass](/wiki/Sass), and [Rake](/wiki/Rake). Now that I am used to producing websites within the context of [Rails](/wiki/Rails) I can't really stand the tedium and ugliness of working with raw [HTML](/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](/wiki/CSS) in other contexts.
