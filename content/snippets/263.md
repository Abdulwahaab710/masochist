I've given up hope of getting online with my current wireless provider; just placed a request for a good old-fashioned ADSL connection, this time with the ex-government-sponsored monopoly (and current infrastructure monopolist), [Telefonica](http://www.telefonica.es/). The most expensive, but probably the most reliable and responsive too.
