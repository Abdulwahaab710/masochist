[Arq](/wiki/Arq) is good, but it is sloooow. I'm doing a full upload of about 150 GB of data to [Glacier](/wiki/Glacier), replacing the old [S3](/wiki/S3) backup. At the rate it's averaged so far over the first 19 hours, it will take 20 days of continuous uploading to finish. I'm hoping it's going to speed up as it goes. Not sure what the bottleneck is, but it's averaging only 225 KB/sec, which is nowhere near the actual upload bandwidth I have.
