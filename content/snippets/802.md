The `~/Library` folder is now hidden by default, although you can still [get to it](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110720140120641) in the [GUI](/wiki/GUI) or [unhide it](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110704093233123). (I suspect that last one might end up getting undone with every point update of the [OS](/wiki/OS), though.)
