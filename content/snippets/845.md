So it turns out there's [a bug](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/3686) in the version of Sprockets that ships with [Rails](/wiki/Rails) 3.1.2 and which explains [one of my complaints](/twitter/673) about the asset pipeline. They've rushed out [a 3.1.3 release](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/11/20/rails-3-1-3-has-been-released) to mitigate the issue.
