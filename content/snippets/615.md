Found [the answer](http://groups.google.com/group/haml/browse_thread/thread/6a685f2cdc267a34) to those 110 failing specs under [Rails 3](/wiki/Rails_3): had to update from [Haml](/wiki/Haml) 3.0.17 to 3.0.18 to get [this commit](http://github.com/nex3/haml/commit/61a1de3ff75e98e92688f9dd2d121a3c9a9c4740) (hot off the press from 3 hours ago).
