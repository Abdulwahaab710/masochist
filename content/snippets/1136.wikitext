[[Hard reset]], necessitated by gradual degradation (Fantastical 2 failing to sync, Calendar.app crashing, MailMate crashing and eventually getting stuck in the Dock even though it wasn't in the process listing any more, system gradually getting slower). Tried to reboot but ultimately had to pull the plug.
