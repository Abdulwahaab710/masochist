[Amazon](/wiki/Amazon) announces [forthcoming support for Oracle](http://aws.amazon.com/rds/oracle/) in its AWS RDS service. Oracle seems to be the new Microsoft — that is, the obnoxious 900-pound gorilla romping around and smashing things — and seems well on the way to becoming "Public Enemy Number One", at least as far as the community of [open source](/wiki/open_source) users is concerned. With any luck Oracle will end up going the way of Microsoft; increasingly antiquated and irrelevant.
