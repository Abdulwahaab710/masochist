I love [Vim](/wiki/Vim), but I can't bring myself to use Vim bindings in [Bash](/wiki/Bash) or [Zsh](/wiki/Zsh); the capabilities are just too watered down (eg. you can't do things like `ge`, or make visual selections, or stuff like `ci(`). Given that, I prefer to maintain a stark separation between my editor world and my command line work rather than have a fuzzy blur between the capabilities of one world and the other.
