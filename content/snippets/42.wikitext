title: Involuntary Reboot Log 3.8 and 3.9
tags: involuntary.reboot.log
---
Third and fourth failures on [[Lion]]. One a system lockup (mouse pointer froze, media playback stalled, machine became unusable), and another a spontaneous reboot during the reboot after the [[hard reset]]. Ouch. Lion is proving to be much less stable than either [[Leopard]] or [[Snow Leopard]] ever were.

* Kernel panics: 3
* Hard resets: 6
* Total failures: 9
* Start of recording keeping: 14 March 2011
