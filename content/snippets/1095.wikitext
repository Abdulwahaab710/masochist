Network connection was spotty, so tried to turn off Wi-Fi and switch to tethering. Wi-Fi stayed on. Successively more apps started to beachball. Tried quitting as many as possible, but in the end even the clock stopped updating so I decided to do a [[hard reset]].

This is my first [[involuntary reboot]] on [[Yosemite]], and this machine is doing well, approaching the best MTBF I've had so far (currently at 37.875 days, previous record was 41.86 days).

= Statistics so far =

* Failure type: [[hard reset]]
* OS version: 10.10.1
* Uptime at moment of failure: approximately 2 days
* Kernel panics: 1
* Hard resets: 7
* Total failures: 8
* Start of recording keeping: 21 January 2014
* Total days to date: 303 days
* Average time between failures: 37.875 days

= Historical data =

For comparison, previous generations of machines (from most oldest to most recent) that I've used have had averages of:

* [/blog/involuntary-reboot-log-60 22.73] days (over 1,364 days)
