So, DHH wants to raise $100,000 for charity to celebrate the release of [Rails 3](/wiki/Rails_3). He's [put $5,000 of his own money where his mouth is](http://mycharitywater.org/p/campaign?campaign_id=6706), and quite a few others have followed suit with big donations. I'm ignorant of the trustworthiness of the particular charity organization chosen, but it seems like a very nice thing to do.
