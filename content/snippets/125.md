Closed the machine when it was on low battery. On opening it back up it ran for about a minute before I had time to realize it was about to die. On dying, I plugged in the power immediately and hit the power button; was presented with a login screen different from what I've seen before (one with only my user photo and a password field) and then after entering my password there was a full reboot. I consider this a [hard reset](/wiki/hard_reset).
