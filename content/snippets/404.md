Server move coming up in about a week; I'm going to see if I can switch from [Mongrel](/wiki/Mongrel) to [Unicorn](/wiki/Unicorn) as part of the migration. Wonder if that will put an end to those periodic restarts (dead mongrel processes needing to be restart by [Monit](/wiki/Monit) every couple of days).
