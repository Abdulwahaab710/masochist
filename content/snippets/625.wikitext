Annoying Google Groups behavior that I've been seeing lately: requiring you to log in to ''read'' (not reply to) ''public'' postings, like [http://groups.google.com/group/yardoc/t/22e6cf5cf375c53c this one] (the [[YARD]] 0.6.1 release announcement). It's made doubly annoying because the login form is constructed in such a way that Safari's form auto-filling doesn't work with it, so you have to manually type in your passphrase every time.
