[Rails](/wiki/Rails) 3.1 will see CoffeeScript replace JavaScript as the default "language" for scripts. [Nerdrage ensues](https://github.com/rails/rails/compare/9333ca7...23aa7da). I'm a little surprised by this move, and am doubtful about the benefits (prettier syntax in exchange for another layer of abstraction and more complex dependencies).
