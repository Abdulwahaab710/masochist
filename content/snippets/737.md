Wow. Just learned that [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby) does implicit string concatenation, just like [C](/wiki/C) does (ie. `"foo" "bar"` evaluates to `"foobar"`). I wonder whether it is actually doing a message send to join the strings, or whether this is happening at the lexer/parser level prior to evaluation.
