Tim Pope's [fugitive.vim](http://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) is a [Git](/wiki/Git) wrapper for [Vim](/wiki/Vim) that might be worth trying out. (I've had [vim-git](http://github.com/motemen/git-vim/tree/master) installed for a long time now, but it had some annoying quirks which I had to patch and development seems to have stalled, so I end up Command-Tabbing out to the [Terminal](/wiki/Terminal) to do basically everything anyway.)
