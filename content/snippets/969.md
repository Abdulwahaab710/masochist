There's an element of unintended irony about [this question](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101023220104AALe72R) that gave me a good chuckle: "I have boy/girl twins who will be three next month. I don't plan on telling them that there is a man dressed in red and white fur who brings children to good little girls and boys. I feel why lie to them about that. If I do won't that make them also wonder if we lied to them about God?"
