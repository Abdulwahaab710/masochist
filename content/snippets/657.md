There is talk on the Git mailing list of upping the default length for SHA-1 abbreviations from 7 characters to, most likely, 12, to avoid the number of collisions in large projects. There's also talk of making this length configurable. In my own Git repo browser that I've developed for this site, I went with a length of 16. Most definitely overkill, but I am a sucker for powers of two.
