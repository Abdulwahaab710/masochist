Tim Pope's [http://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive fugitive.vim] is a [[Git]] wrapper for [[Vim]] that might be worth trying out. (I've had [http://github.com/motemen/git-vim/tree/master vim-git] installed for a long time now, but it had some annoying quirks which I had to patch and development seems to have stalled, so I end up Command-Tabbing out to the [[Terminal]] to do basically everything anyway.)
