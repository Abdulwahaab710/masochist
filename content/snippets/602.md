`sftp` works great with non-shell accounts given to untrusted users; you can use the built-in [SFTP](/wiki/SFTP) server provided by [OpenSSH](/wiki/OpenSSH) to chroot them into their home directories. The problem: you lose the scriptability that `scp` provides (eg. uploading files from a [Rake](/wiki/Rake) task). The solution: `sftp -b` to the rescue!
