Wonderful to see [Gitorious](http://blog.gitorious.org/2009/05/11/welcome-qt/) [chosen](http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2009/05/11/qt-public-repository-launched/) as the host for Qt's revamped [development](http://www.qtsoftware.com/developer/the-qt-contribution-model) efforts. It's very pleasing to see investment in an [open source](/wiki/open_source) solution which predates the closed-source, proprietary GitHub.
