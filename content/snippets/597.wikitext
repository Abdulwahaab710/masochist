Just tried running [[Walrus]] under [[JRuby]], for kicks, to see how performance is with batch-processing a large number of templates using `walrus fill`; unsurprisingly, it rips through them very quickly and memory usage is relatively low despite the memoization employed by the [[packrat parser]]. [[MRI]], on the other hand, suffers from crippling memory bloat under this kind of workload; you either exhaust all memory on the system (because it doesn't get Garbage Collected even though it should) and your machines slows to a halt and the run never ends, or you CTRL-C the process.
