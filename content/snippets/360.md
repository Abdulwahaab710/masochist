I currently use expensive dedicated managed hosting, but I think that when my contract expires I'll be moving my Rails app to [Engine Yard Cloud](http://www.engineyard.com/products/cloud/pricing/price-estimator) or similar (or even just doing the Amazon set-up myself), and moving my mail, [Git](/wiki/Git), and other [HTTP](/wiki/HTTP) hosting to a cheaper virtual host solution.
