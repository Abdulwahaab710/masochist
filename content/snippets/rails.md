Been quite busy with [Rails](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Rails) stuff lately (website improvements); as an example, he's an article I just posted to the [wiki](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/wiki) with the lessons learned from this morning: "[Validating passwords with Ruby on Rails](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Validating%20passwords%20with%20Ruby%20on%20Rails)".
