Never bothered to update to [FixtureReplacement](/wiki/FixtureReplacement) 2.0 (if it ain't broke don't fix it), but looking at [what's gone into 3.0](http://github.com/smtlaissezfaire/fixturereplacement), I think I'll be moving. Most interesting is the solution of the "cyclic dependencies" problem.
