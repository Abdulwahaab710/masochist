Trying out [iTerm 2](/wiki/iTerm_2) because I am sick of [Vim](/wiki/Vim) looking so ugly in the [Snow Leopard](/wiki/Snow_Leopard) [Terminal](/wiki/Terminal) due to its lack of 256-color support. Observations so far: its rendering looks to be about half as fast as the Snow Leopard Terminal, but other than that it looks pretty solid.
