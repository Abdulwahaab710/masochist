Didn't go for the [http://www.apple.com/keyboard/ wireless keyboard]. For me, the lack of numeric keypad, the lack of USB ports, and the inherent flakiness of wireless connections make this a pretty unattractive option for me. Instead, I opted for the [http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB110LL/A traditional USB keyboard]. It will be the second such keyboard that I've owned. Best Apple has ever made in my opinion. Quiet, comfortable, easy to keep clean, and utterly reliable.
