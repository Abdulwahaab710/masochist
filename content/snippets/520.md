Frustratingly, I have a bunch of requests which simply die after updating to Rails 3. The log shows the request coming in, but no errors are raised nor is control passed to the expected controller action; all I get is a zero-byte response body. Hard to troubleshoot, and no obvious patterns other than it seems to affect all `controller#create` type `POST` requests.
