Deciding whether to [http://blog.jquery.com/2013/01/15/jquery-1-9-final-jquery-2-0-beta-migrate-final-released/ stick to jQuery 1.9 or jump to 2.0], here are some numbers from Google Analytics:

# Chrome: 49.34%
# Firefox: 22.97%
# Safari: 20.94%
# Internet Explorer: 3.16%
# Opera: 1.65%
# Opera Mini: 0.84%
# Mozilla Compatible Agent: 0.33%
# Android Browser: 0.23%
# Safari (in-app): 0.16%
# Nokia5130c-2: 0.06%

Drilling down into that IE segment:

# 9.0: 38.70%
# 8.0: 37.01%
# 10.0: 9.60%
# 7.0: 9.04%
# 6.0: 5.65%

So, only 1.63% of all visitors would have potentially broken functionality if I were to jump to 2.0.
