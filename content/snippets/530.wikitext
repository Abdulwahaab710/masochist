In [/twitter/349 this tweet] I wrote about how glad I was that [[Ruby]] could be broken up over multiple lines in [[Haml]] templates now. Sadly, after trying it out a bit, I can't really make use of it yet because it messes up my Haml syntax highlighting too much... Wonder whether it will be feasible to update that.
