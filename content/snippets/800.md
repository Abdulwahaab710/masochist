Awesome: found out in [this ticket](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/issues/120) how to get the [Solarized](/wiki/Solarized) color scheme displaying properly in [Vim](/wiki/Vim) in [iTerm2](/wiki/iTerm2). Now there are only three things that I'd like to see fixed or improved in iTerm2: getting up to speed parity with Apple's [Terminal](/wiki/Terminal) app, reducing the flakiness of the search, and probably most importantly of all, fixing the bizarre corruption that happens when doing readline editing on a line that is too wide to fit in the window without wrapping.
