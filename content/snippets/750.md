In an unexpected move, [Capybara](/wiki/Capybara) just [built in](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/commit/f4897f890d8dd33215fef238902988e8823a6539) a couple of aliases that effectively allow it to stand in for [Steak](/wiki/Steak). When Steak first started it really was little more than these aliases, and although it has been fleshed out considerably since then, at its core it still remains just that.
