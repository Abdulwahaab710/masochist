[http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/01/bing-google-fight/ More on MS vs Google]. Looks like some angry tweets have been flying! For me, the most insightful comment on this one is [http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2168643 the following]: " whether Bing intentionally copied Google's search results or not, if Bing continues this practice then their index will contain a de facto copy of Google's index for tricky queries. Bing will inherit Google's spelling correction, it's long tail, its top results, and any other enhancements Google develops to return more relevant results."
