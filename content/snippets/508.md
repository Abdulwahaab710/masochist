Another horrible little convention that's crept into the Rails codebase: the use of `.gitkeep` files to allow the creation of what would otherwise be empty directories in the repository. A `.gitignore` file would be a better choice seeing as that at least can be populated with content to serve an actual purpose (ie. describing what should and should not be tracked in the directory). The `.gitkeep` file, on the other hand, does literally nothing and has no special meaning for Git despite the fact that its name misleading conveys that it somehow does.
