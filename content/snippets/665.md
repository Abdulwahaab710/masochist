Oracle: [a class act](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/11/06/oracle_dueling_jvms/). I'm not a Java programmer, thankfully, but if I was I'd probably already have jumped ship by now. As I've alluded elsewhere, I'm anticipating that jumping from the MySQL ship (to PostgreSQL, evidently) will eventually become inevitable as well.
