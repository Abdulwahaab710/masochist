[Mountain Lion](/wiki/Mountain_Lion) goodness: Scrollbars become substantially thicker when you interact with them (the dynamic is a little clunky — you effectively have to scroll a little first and then move the pointer over the scrollbar; you can't just do the two-finger tap because that will be interpreted as a right-click, and you can't just hover the pointer over the edge of the scroll area either — but it's still a massive improvement).
