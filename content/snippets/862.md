[GoDaddy](/wiki/GoDaddy) supports the stupid and harmful SOPA legislation. Switch your domains to a [non-brain-damaged](http://community.namecheap.com/blog/2011/12/22/we-say-no-to-sopa/) registrar like [Namecheap](http://www.namecheap.com/) instead. I started moving my domains away from GoDaddy to [Joker](/wiki/Joker) a long time ago.
