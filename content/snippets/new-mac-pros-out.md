title: New Mac Pros out
---

[Only just found out](http://www.macworld.com/article/131461/2008/01/macproupdate.html) about this... have been very busy with work of late and so haven't really been keeping up to date with the news. While I would certainly love one of these machines, I'll probably be sticking with the trusty old first-gen Intel iMac for a while yet.
