title: Open4
---

I just released my first [RubyGem](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/RubyGem) or [RubyForge](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/RubyForge). It's a very simple replacement for Open3 in the [Ruby Standard Library](http://www.wincent.com/knowledge-base/Ruby%20Standard%20Library). You can get [Open4 version 0.1 here](http://rubyforge.org/frs/shownotes.php?release_id=10715).
