Geez, had no idea that there is a [Shellworlds module](http://blog.grayproductions.net/articles/the_secret_shell_helper) in [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby), and that is has been backported from Ruby 1.9 to 1.8.7 (at least, it's present on the standard system Ruby that comes with [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) [Snow Leopard](/wiki/Snow_Leopard)).
