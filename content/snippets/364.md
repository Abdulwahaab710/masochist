I see that [Gem Bundler is the Future](http://litanyagainstfear.com/blog/2009/10/14/gem-bundler-is-the-future/), apparently. See also [this guide](http://tomafro.net/2009/11/a-rails-template-for-gem-bundler) to getting started using it. I'll probably be waiting until [Rails](/wiki/Rails) 3 forces me to change my existing set-up (if it ain't broke...).
