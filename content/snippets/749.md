Oh dear. Looks like the PowerBook's hard drive is dying after 7 years of faithful service. Started making alarming, loud, clunking sounds last night and the machine eventually freezes up. For now have [turned off Spotlight](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20071102215912892) to minimize disk access, and am hoping that I can limp along for the next few days.
