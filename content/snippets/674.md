On revising all the comments on GitHub's "[we accidentally deleted the database](https://github.com/blog/744-today-s-outage)" post, it seems they either have very able moderators, or nobody but gushing fanbois has bothered to post a reply. Somehow this epic failure is being branded as grounds for praise. And somehow, the idea of keeping your test environment separated from your production environment is labelled as a brilliant, when in reality it's just a no-brainer (in this age of [cloud computing](/wiki/cloud_computing) if you accidentally blow away your production environment because you ran tests directly on it rather than just temporarily spinning up a clone for testing purposes, you were frankly asking for it).
