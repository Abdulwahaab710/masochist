One of the downsides of the move to the Mac App Store: some applications that I purchased in the past (like [Net Monitor](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/net-monitor/id480482806)) are only available on the Mac App Store now, and there's no way to side-grade your license; you have to purchase again. Good thing it's only 10 bucks nowadays. This is a double shame in the case of Net Monitor because it intentionally bars itself from running on each major operating system release (like [Mountain Lion](/wiki/Mountain_Lion), for example), requiring an "upgrade", and the somewhat ghetto [non-App Store site](http://netmonitor.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/download.html) only hosts old versions.
