This time a [hard reset](/wiki/hard_reset) caused by problems copying from a FAT-formatted USB stick. Specifically, the copy failed, and upon retrying the Finder [beach balled](/wiki/beach_balled). I force quit the Finder after waiting for several minutes, but after that it refused to re-open. Upon trying to reboot the machine it hung indefinitely at the spinning progress indicator, necessitating a hard reset.
