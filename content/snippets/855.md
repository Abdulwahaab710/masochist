So I'm "puppetizing" my [EC2](/wiki/EC2) servers. The approach I used to use before [Puppet](/wiki/Puppet) was to create a base, [EBS](/wiki/EBS)-backed [AMI](/wiki/AMI) and push as much configuration as possible out onto a separate EBS "data" volume. That configuration would get pulled in via `include` directives (where the service in question supported it) or via creative mounting (eg. setting up `/etc/fstab` to mount `/data/mysql` at `/var/lib/mysql`). Moving towards Puppet means less of that, and more of just sticking the configuration files in Puppet and telling it to put them where they belong on the base AMI.
