title: Apple Xcode bug reports
---

I just checked the list of Xcode bugs that I've filed with Apply lately and I see that recently I've been averaging two new reports per day. All of them still marked as "Open"... Now just waiting for Apple to do the usual and mark them as "Duplicate", "Behaves correctly" or "Insufficient information"...
