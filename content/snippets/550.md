Have spent literally all day now (and parts of the weekend) trying to figure out why `rspec spec/acceptance` works but both `bundle exec rspec spec/acceptance` and `rake spec:acceptance` hang mysteriously during Steak/Capybara/Culerity/Celerity examples. There is something hideously subtle about the difference between the two environments (I have basically the exact same gems on my system and in my `BUNDLE_PATH`) and I haven't been able to get to the bottom of it yet.
