[http://aws.amazon.com/message/65648/ Amazon's summary of the incident].

And in an email I just received:

> Weâ€™ve identified that you had an attached EBS volume or a running RDS database instance in the affected Availability Zone at the time of the disruption.  Regardless of whether your resources and application were impacted, we are going to provide a 10 day credit (for the period 4/18-4/27) equal to 100% of your usage of EBS Volumes, EC2 Instances and RDS database instances that were running in the affected Availability Zone.
