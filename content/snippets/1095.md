Network connection was spotty, so tried to turn off Wi-Fi and switch to tethering. Wi-Fi stayed on. Successively more apps started to beachball. Tried quitting as many as possible, but in the end even the clock stopped updating so I decided to do a [hard reset](/wiki/hard_reset).

This is my first [involuntary reboot](/wiki/involuntary_reboot) on [Yosemite](/wiki/Yosemite), and this machine is doing well, approaching the best MTBF I've had so far (currently at 37.875 days, previous record was 41.86 days).
