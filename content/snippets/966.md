Neil Finn's "[Song of the Lonely Mountain](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/neil-finn-reaches-epic-heights-on-song-of-the-lonely-mountain-song-premiere-20121112)"; underwhelming, compared to the final tracks on the three Lord of the Ring soundtracks. I feel like even the weakest of those ("May It Be", by Enya) eclipses this, and the strongest ("Into the West", by Annie Lennox) knocks it (far, far) out of the park.
