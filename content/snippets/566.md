Pleasantly surprised to see that the current HEAD of the [RR](/wiki/RR) master branch, even though it's several months since the last commit, fixes two issues that were affecting me (inability to `proxy` private methods, and inability to `raise` from inside `ActionMailer` doubles). Now there's only [one issue left](http://github.com/btakita/rr/issues/40) on my list.
