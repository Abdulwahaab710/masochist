Sigh. The once-excellent MailTemplate is broken on [Snow Leopard](/wiki/Snow_Leopard) because [the vendor](http://mailtemplate.mactank.com/) chooses not to update it. They [claim](http://blog.mactank.com/2009/12/30/mailtemplate-on-snow-leopard-workaround) that "Basically, dynamic contextual menu do not work in 64-bit applications on Snow Leopard", which is simply not true, in my opinion ([counter-example](http://c-command.com/spamsieve/)). If I recall correctly, this formerly fantastic product was originally written by [Abracode](http://www.abracode.com/), and used to be free or nearly free, but the code base was then bought by Mactank and allowed to stagnate without any further development for literally years (no updates at all in the last 4 years, 3 updates in 2006, 2 updates in 2005), despite their claims about "reinvigorating our development efforts on MailTemplate". Worst of all, I bet I could fix the program in a day with access to the source, and probably rewrite it from scratch in about a week.
