Deciding whether to [stick to jQuery 1.9 or jump to 2.0](http://blog.jquery.com/2013/01/15/jquery-1-9-final-jquery-2-0-beta-migrate-final-released/), here are some numbers from Google Analytics:

1.  Chrome: 49.34%
2.  Firefox: 22.97%
3.  Safari: 20.94%
4.  Internet Explorer: 3.16%
5.  Opera: 1.65%
6.  Opera Mini: 0.84%
7.  Mozilla Compatible Agent: 0.33%
8.  Android Browser: 0.23%
9.  Safari (in-app): 0.16%
10. Nokia5130c-2: 0.06%

Drilling down into that IE segment:

1.  9.0: 38.70%
2.  8.0: 37.01%
3.  10.0: 9.60%
4.  7.0: 9.04%
5.  6.0: 5.65%

So, only 1.63% of all visitors would have potentially broken functionality if I were to jump to 2.0.
