In [this tweet](/twitter/349) I wrote about how glad I was that [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby) could be broken up over multiple lines in [Haml](/wiki/Haml) templates now. Sadly, after trying it out a bit, I can't really make use of it yet because it messes up my Haml syntax highlighting too much... Wonder whether it will be feasible to update that.
