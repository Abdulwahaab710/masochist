My CPU (an [Intel Core Duo T2400 @ 1.83 GHz](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/stats/imac_cd_1.83_17.html)) doesn't even appear on [this interesting chart](http://www.cpubenchmark.net/common_cpus.html), but we can assume that it is somewhat slower than its closest successor (the Intel Core2 Duo T5750 @ 2 GHz), and more than 6 times slower than the current leader (Intel Core I7 965 @ 3.2 GHz).
