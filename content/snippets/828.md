I just discovered [github.com/vim-scripts](https://github.com/vim-scripts/Command-T/commits/master), and enormous collection containing Git reops with snapshots of every release of every plug-in on vim.org, including my own [Command-T](https://github.com/vim-scripts/Command-T/commits/master). I wonder who the hell went out and did this, it's such an awesome service to the community (particularly for those of us who want to just clone Git repos and manage our plug-ins via [Pathogen](/wiki/Pathogen) rather than dealing with yucky vimballs).
