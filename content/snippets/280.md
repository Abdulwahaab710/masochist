[Capistrano](/wiki/Capistrano) just locked me out of my own server. Looks like it retries public key auth three times for every single `cap` operation, despite the fact that it has a password configured, and this ends up causing the firewall to temporarily lock me out because it starts looking like a bruteforce attack.
