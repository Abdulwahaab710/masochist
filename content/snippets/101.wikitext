title: Involuntary Reboot Log 3.28 and 3.29
tags: involuntary.reboot.log
---
First, a kernel panic on reboot after applying software updates from [[Apple]]. Then, a gradual deadlock from trying to run three VMs at once in Parallels (whoops); the machine eventually ground to a halt becoming completely unresponsive (no clock updates, no mouse pointer movement etc), requiring a hard reset.

= Statistics so far =

* Kernel panics: 6
* Hard resets: 23
* Total failures: 29
* Start of recording keeping: 14 March 2011
* Total days to date: 579 days
* Average time between failures: 19.97 days
