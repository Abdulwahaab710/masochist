Another Chrome crash, this time typing into the Facebook composer. It beachballed and more and more apps locked up successively. Quit as many of them as I could, but ultimately had to do a [hard reset](/wiki/hard_reset).

This machine's stability is really nose-diving, down from a peak of 37.875 days between failures.
