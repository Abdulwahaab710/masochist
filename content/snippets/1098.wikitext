Another Chrome crash, this time typing into the Facebook composer. It beachballed and more and more apps locked up successively. Quit as many of them as I could, but ultimately had to do a [[hard reset]].

This machine's stability is really nose-diving, down from a peak of 37.875 days between failures.

= Statistics so far =

* Failure type: [[hard reset]]
* OS version: 10.10.1
* Uptime at moment of failure: unknown (days)
* Kernel panics: 1
* Hard resets: 9
* Total failures: 10
* Start of recording keeping: 21 January 2014

= Historical data =

For comparison, previous generations of machines (from most oldest to most recent) that I've used have had averages of:

* [/blog/involuntary-reboot-log-60 22.73] days (over 1,364 days)
* [/snippets/23 20.06] (over 321 days)
