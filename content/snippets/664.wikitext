Bored to death of reading about the polemic Zed Shaw. I want to  keep abreast of interesting technical developments, not things like [http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/e1uuv/please_take_this_down_and_write_your_own_book_zed/ this latest storm in a tea cup]. Unfortunately, given the size of Zed's ego and his insatiable thirst for attention, the chance of him ever doing a "_why"-style disappearing act are infinitesimal.
