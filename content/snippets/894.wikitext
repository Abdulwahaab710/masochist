Just registered [http://wincent.co/ wincent.co] (redirecting to wincent.com, obviously). Many is the time I've missed the final "m" on a dot-com domain. Everybody should have one. I find this curiously delightful, as I've always found the "Co" abbreviation for "Company" to be amusing; probably because of those old Warner Bros cartoons that I grew up with that so often featured "Acme Co". <irony>Will also be useful if I ever decide to open for business in Colombia</irony>.
