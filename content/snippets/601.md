[fugitive.vim](/wiki/fugitive.vim) is a great interface to [Git](/wiki/Git) from inside [Vim](/wiki/Vim). The only thing which bugs me about it is that when you stage changes on a per-hunk basis you don't get the nice syntax highlighting that you would in the [Terminal](/wiki/Terminal) using `git add --interactive`. The answer? [Conque](http://code.google.com/p/conque/): it allows you to run [command-line](/wiki/command-line) programs from inside [Vim](/wiki/Vim), including running [Bash](/wiki/Bash) with color.
