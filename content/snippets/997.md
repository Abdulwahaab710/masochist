Awesome. [tmux](/wiki/tmux) 1.8 is out, and the new `copy-pipe` command [makes it possible](/repos/clipper/commits/9cc918c0bec016) to use [Clipper](/wiki/Clipper) to seamlessly get anything you copy in tmux copy mode into the [OS X](/wiki/OS_X) system clipboard (ie. with no additional key-presses).
