Didn't get it done on the weekend as I'd hoped due to lack of access to the computer, but I'm very pleased to report that my "Command-T for Vim" [/twitter/290 project] has just reached a milestone: working prompt and filtering match window which updates correctly as you type, with items sorted in a very intuitive order.
