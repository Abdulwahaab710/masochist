I'd previously looked at Xcode 4, but not done any real work with it. On Snow Leopard I continued to use Xcode 3.x. But with Lion, I'm now forced to use Xcode 4.1, and I am finding that the move from Xcode 3's "Build Styles" and "Configurations" to Xcode 4's "Schemes" has horribly broken my existing build processes. And while I've read a bunch of blog posts and also the official documentation, it's not really clear to me how I am supposed to distinguish between a local development (debug) build and a deployment (release) build. The project lists "Debug" and "Release" under "Configurations", but I can't see any way to edit or select them. And the "Schemes" selector only allows me to select among targets. (For the last few hours it also was letting me select between 32 and 64-bit architectures, but I've found that on quitting and re-opening Xcode it's only showing me a 64-bit option.)
