In Feburary 2006 I filed a bug report with [Apple](/wiki/Apple) about how [Xcode](/wiki/Xcode) set the `DEVELOPMENT_LANGUAGE` environment variable during Shell Script build phases to "English", even when the `CFBundleDevelopmentRegion` in the `Info.plist` was set to some other value (such as "en"). Today, nearly 5 years later, I finally get a reply, informing me that they believe the bug has been addressed in the latest version of Xcode. This was evidently a trivial bug which Apple didn't consider to be very high priority; if this had been in an [open source](/wiki/open_source) project, however, I could have submitted a quick fix myself.
