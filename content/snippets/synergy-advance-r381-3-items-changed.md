Fix affine clamp 'smear' for non-square cover art (when displayed instead of the Synergy Advance icon); don't bother with generating clear backgrounds for non-square images (it appears that all non-image pixels are transparent anyway); minor reformatting; improve efficiency by avoiding unnecessary duplicate calls to the squareIconSizedImage method
