This one the machine appeared dead while trying to wake from sleep. Mouse and keyboard were apparently non-responsive, apart from the brightness keys. I did a hard reset, only too late realizing that it was likely something fishy with my external monitor not coming on (and thus preventing me from seeing the login dialog).
