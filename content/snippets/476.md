Was hoping to get the new iMac by Monday, but looks very unlikely. Apple called just to "check up" on the order, I told them I did the payment by bank transfer yesterday, and they said that it is usually "several days" before they can see it at their end. So looks more like it will be mid-week, and hopefully not later than that.
