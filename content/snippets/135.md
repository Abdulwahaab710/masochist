Another instant [kernel panic](/wiki/kernel_panic) trying to mount an Amazon [S3](/wiki/S3) bucket as a disk using [Transmit](/wiki/Transmit). This time at the suggestion of Panic support (reinstall then try again).

On a hunch I then switched my standard account from normal user to administrator and tried again. It works.
