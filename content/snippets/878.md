Since [Lion](/wiki/Lion) added the whole "your documents are saved and restored transparently across reboots" thing, I've noticed that I'm using random unsaved TextEdit documents for taking ephemeral notes. This kind of sucks, as I end up with a bunch of unsaved, long-lived, open docs with names like "Untitled 8". Checking out [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/) as an alternative. Looks like it might be just what the doctor ordered.
