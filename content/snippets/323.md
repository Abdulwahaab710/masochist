As I find working in [Xcode](/wiki/Xcode) to be more and more annoying, I'm forced to set up [Vim](/wiki/Vim) to do some [IDE](/wiki/IDE)-like things. Just installed [a.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=31) to make switching between alternate files (source and header files, for example) easy.
