Free from the torturous yolk of AT&T at last. I now have degraded data service (via T-Mobile's Edge network) on my iPhone 4, but at half the cost of AT&T, and the phone is unlocked to boot. (I wouldn't have minded paying the AT&T premium in exchange for premium service, but the truth is it was spotty and slow.)
