Spotlight had been churning for literally days, so I decided to reboot, only to find myself at a gray screen, requiring a [[hard reset]].

With an average time between failures of over 40 days, this machine is the most reliable one I've ever had.

= Statistics so far =

* Failure type: [[hard reset]]
* Uptime at moment of failure: unknown
* Kernel panics: 3
* Hard resets: 4
* Total failures: 7
* Start of recording keeping: 6 March 2013
* Total days to date: 293 days
* Average time between failures: 41.86 days
