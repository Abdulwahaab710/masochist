When I first got on the Internet in the mid-90s, I was afflicted with an obsession to collect everything and never discard anything. This started with my first 1GB hard drive, and then a 4GB one, and a CD burner, and so on. By the early 2000s I had made a conscious decision to scale back. Now I'm going further. Resolution: if I have more data than can fit on the 250 GB drive of the MacBook Air, I have too much data.
