[GitHub goes down](http://status.github.com/), alarm ensues. Is anybody really surprised that this incredibly complex, distributed, fragile stack (which hosts well over 1,000,000 Git repos, even if most of them are just forks or gists) is not 100% robust? I personally use GitHub as merely a mirror for the "real", authoritative, self-hosted repos. There's no way I would consider paying for it, especially with such a short track record.
