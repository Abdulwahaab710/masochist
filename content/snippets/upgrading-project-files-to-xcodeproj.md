title: Upgrading project files to xcodeproj

How annoying... Upgrading a single project to the new 2.1 format is not too bad but when you have a hierarchy of interdependent projects like I do in Synergy Advance it's a royal pain in the butt... Something that you could build yesterday with the click of a button only builds today after several hours of painful fiddling.
