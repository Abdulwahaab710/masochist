Digging around looking for background on [Apple's ZFS discontinuation](/twitter/182), found [this post](http://jobs.apple.com/index.ajs?method=mExternal.showJob&RID=42559) that indicates that [Apple](/wiki/Apple) is using [Subversion](/wiki/Subversion) and [Git](/wiki/Git) internally. Nice to see that they're not wedded to a proprietary system like [Perforce](/wiki/Perforce).
