Ew, [a nasty bug in SpamAssassin](https://issues.apache.org/SpamAssassin/show_bug.cgi?id=6269) (via [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/akjb3/y2k10_bug_in_spamassassin/)). Just patched the offending rule and did a manual check of my spam folder: over 300 messages quarantined over the last 24 hours but no false positives.
