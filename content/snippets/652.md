Yehuda Katz: [Steak](/wiki/Steak) is "[essentially a scam](http://twitter.com/wycats/status/26769271290)". He's right that Steak is indeed "just" a set of aliases for RSpec, but he misses that it's precisely that fact which is its major selling point. (He too could replace the thousands of lines of over-engineered complexity that is Cucumber and work in an overhead-free acceptance-testing environment.)
