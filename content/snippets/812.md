Search tokens in [Lion](/wiki/Lion) are pretty cool, finally bringing fast, flexible and powerful search to [Mail.app](/wiki/Mail.app) (eg. try typing a search like "last week" (accept "Date" selection from drop down), keeping typing "jimmy" (accept "Person" selection from drop down), and you can rapidly drill down to the messages you're interested in finding. The Finder, which has long had a search of a similar power, makes the power more easily accessible thanks to search tokens.
