Finally back online as of only a few minutes ago and am starting the long, slow process of catching up:

-   synching email accounts (I've been using a web interface on a borrowed laptop, on a borrowed WiFi network up til now)
-   pulling down a few hundred meg of pent-up software updates from [Apple](/wiki/Apple)
-   waiting for [iTunes](/wiki/iTunes) to sync its podcasts
-   pushing more than a hundred commits out to remote [Git](/wiki/Git) repositories
-   getting back on top of support tickets and the like

So it will take a while, but at least I've turned the corner!

One bit of good news, at least, is that I am literally only 200 meters from the exchange, so this is the first time my ADSL provider has been able to deliver the speeds they advertise (it's a 6 megabit connection, and I'm currently downloading at over 650 kilobytes per second).

**Update (2 hours later):** Nope. Back offline again. The short version: a dead router which lasted only an hour. See [this post](/blog/back-offline-again) for the full details.
