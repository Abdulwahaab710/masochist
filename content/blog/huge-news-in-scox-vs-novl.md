title: Huge news in SCOX vs NOVL

If you have SCO stock (I trust that no one reading this weblog does) the time to sell is now. Well, you may as well just burn all the paperwork and forget about it.

After weeks wondering how the judge would rule in the various summary judgment motions the final word is now out ("final" in quotation marks because you can rest assured that SCO will appeal, scream and wail until every last cent is emptied from its coffers).

Groklaw has the [writeup](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070810165237718) ([Slashdot follow-up](http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/10/2148253)). The highlights from the [102 page ruling](http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/Novell-377.pdf):

-   "court concludes that Novell is the owner of the UNIX and UnixWare Copyrights"
-   "SCO is obligated to recognize Novell's waiver of SCO's claims against IBM and Sequent"

Will be very interesting to [watch SCO's stock price](http://finance.google.com/finance?cid=664357) plummet over the next few days. Anyone care to place any bets on how long it will take for them to go bankrupt and be delisted from the stock exchange?

Wish I could say that's it's nice to see them finally getting their just deserts, but the sad truth is that the real scoundrels (Darl McBride being the principal scumbag) already lined their pockets from this debacle years ago. It's highly unlikely that we'll see him or any of his cohorts truly penalized for their involvement in this affair.
