I just pushed [Synergy](/wiki/Synergy) version 6.0a2, containing a possible fix for a crash ([bug \#2173](/issues/2173)). I can't reproduce the crash here, so that's why this is only a "possible" fix.

See [the 6.0a release announcement](/blog/synergy-6.0a-release) for more details about what's new in 6.0.
