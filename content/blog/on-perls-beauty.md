From a [comment](http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=382803&cid=21613555) on [this Slashdot story](http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/12/07/1511240):

> Every year the design for Perl 6 becomes more and more contorted and ultra-complicated, basically taking every cool feature Larry sees in other languages and mashing them together into an incoherent Mulligan stew. If Perl is like "whale guts everywhere" then Perl 6 is like taking a whole Oceanarium of sea creatures and dropping them through the dual rotors of a crane copter 10,000 feet over Manhattan.
