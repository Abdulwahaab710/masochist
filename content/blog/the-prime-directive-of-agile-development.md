> Keeping the system executing at all times is the prime directive. You never do anything to the system that will break it for more than a few seconds. If you have a huge architectural change to make, you find a way to make that change in tiny little steps that keep the system executing. You find a way to keep all the tests running. You never do anything that breaks the system for more than a few seconds or minutes.
