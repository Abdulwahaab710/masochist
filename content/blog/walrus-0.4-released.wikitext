Version 0.4 of the [[Walrus]] gem has just been released. Walrus is an [[object-oriented templating]] system written in [[Ruby]] and heavily inspired by the [[Cheetah template engine]] (which is written in [[Python]]). It doesn't set out to be a full clone of Cheetah, but it does implement a very large subset of its functionality, and it employs the same directive syntax wherever possible.

This release contains [http://git.wincent.com/Walrus.git/commitdiff/268cf53c384e39a8f76ee32c160a7cef863fa6b9 one minor bugfix] and [http://git.wincent.com/Walrus.git/commitdiff/53927ca133b2e53611b81ddfbbf29f6e1be9f563 one major behavioral change]; the default output extension for filled templates is no longer "html", so you will either need to explicitly pass in the extension (eg. `walrus fill -e html ...`) '''''or''''' rename your templates to include the desired extension:

* if you formerly had `index.tmpl` as your source template, resulting in `index.rb` when compiled and `index.html` when filled
* you'll now have `index.html.tmpl` as your source template, and it will produce `index.html.rb` when compiled and `index.html` when filled

This new approach has a few benefits which are fully explained in the [http://git.wincent.com/Walrus.git/commitdiff/53927ca133b2e53611b81ddfbbf29f6e1be9f563 commit log message].
