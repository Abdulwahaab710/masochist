title: mkdtemp 1.2 released
tags: releases mkdtemp
---
Version 1.2 of the [[mkdtemp]] gem was just released. [[mkdtemp]] is a wrapper for the `mkdtemp()` function in the standard [[C]] library, and it provides an easy means of securely creating temporary directories from within [[Ruby]] code.

This is a minor feature release which adds the ability to pass a block to the `mkdtemp` method which allows you do conveniently execute code within the context of the created directory:

<pre lang="ruby"># this:            # is a shorthand for:
Dir.mkdtemp do     #   dir = Dir.mkdtemp
  puts Dir.pwd     #   Dir.chdir dir do
end                #     puts Dir.pwd
                   #   end</pre>

The full list of changes can be viewed [http://git.wincent.com/mkdtemp.git/shortlog/refs/tags/1.2 here], and the new version can be installed via `sudo gem install mkdtemp`.
