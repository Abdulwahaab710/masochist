So [iTunes Plus](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/05/30itunesplus.html) has just become available here in Spain.

I'm not a big spender on the iTunes store — I've only bought about 30 tracks since the store opened here (mostly because the catalogue doesn't have the kind of music I'm interested in nowadays) — so not too many of my purchased tracks are available to upgrade; just three. In any case I dropped the 90 euro-cents on the line and the downloads are on their way.

Looking forward to more music coming over to the higher-quality, DRM-free format.

And as for the privacy concerns about my identifying information being in downloaded files, I'm not worried at all. It was always a no-brainer that Apple would do this.
