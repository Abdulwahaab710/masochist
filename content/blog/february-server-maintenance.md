I just power-cycled the server in order to switch to a new kernel. Looks like the server was down for about 2 minutes, 15 seconds.

Update notes can be found at "[Updating the kernel from version 2.6.18-92.1.13.el5 to 2.6.18-128.1.1.el5 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.1](/wiki/Updating_the_kernel_from_version_2.6.18-92.1.13.el5_to_2.6.18-128.1.1.el5_on_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_5.1)".
