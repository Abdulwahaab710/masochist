I will be power-cycling the server soon in order to apply a kernel update. Downtime is only expected to be a few minutes. This is the second kernel update so far this month, following [/blog/august-server-maintenance the first] which took place three weeks ago.

'''Update:''' The machine is now back up. Downtime was approximately 2 minutes 16 seconds. Notes on the process can be found [[Updating the kernel from version 2.6.18-128.1.10.el5 to 2.6.18-128.7.1.el5 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3|here]].
