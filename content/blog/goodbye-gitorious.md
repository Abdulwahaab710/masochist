title: Goodbye Gitorious
tags: git github gitorious

I've long maintained a mirror on [Gitorious](/wiki/Gitorious) of all my public [Git](/wiki/Git) repos, but with the [recent announcement](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/03/03/gitlab-acquires-gitorious/) that they are being acquired by GitLab, I'm turning off the mirroring and I won't be setting up a replacement.

My public repos will continue to be hosted at [git.wincent.com](http://git.wincent.com/), with mirrors under [my GitHub account](https://github.com/wincent). I figure that's probably enough redundancy.
