title: Wikitext 1.12 released
tags: releases wikitext
---
A new version of the [[Wikitext]] gem, version 1.12, is now available. This is a maintenance release which includes a small tweak in preparation for the imminent Rails 3 final release; specifically the strings returned by the `String#w` and `String#to_wikitext` are now marked as "HTML safe" when running under Rails 3. This is a convenience which should make the move from Rails 2 to Rails 3 fairly comfortable for most Wikitext users.

There is still one outstanding issue, involving changes to the templating API in Rails 3; so expect at least one more Wikitext release before Rails 3 can be considered to be fully supported, hopefully within the next day or so.

[[Wikitext]] is a fast wikitext-to-[[HTML]] translator with a syntax very close to that used by [[MediaWiki]]. It is a [[Ruby]] extension written with speed and robustness in mind using a [[Ragel]]-generated [http://git.wincent.com/wikitext.git/blob/HEAD:/ext/wikitext_ragel.rl scanner] and an extremely fast [http://git.wincent.com/wikitext.git/blob/HEAD:/ext/parser.c hand-coded parser], all in [[C]]. It has an enormous [http://git.wincent.com/wikitext.git/tree/HEAD:/spec spec suite].

You can browse the source code repo [http://git.wincent.com/wikitext.git here], or download the [[gem]] from the [http://rubygems.org/gems/wikitext rubygems.org downloads page]. For an overview of how to use the extension check out the [[RDoc]] [http://wikitext.rubyforge.org/ here]. If you have [[RubyGems]] then you can install it with either `gem install wikitext` or `sudo gem install wikitext`.
