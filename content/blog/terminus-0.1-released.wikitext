[https://github.com/wincent/terminus Terminus] is another small [[Vim]] plug-in that I just extracted from [https://github.com/wincent/wincent my dotfiles].

It enhances Vim's integration with the terminal in a few ways:

* Sets up cursor shape changes on entering insert mode.
* Sets up `FocusGained`/`FocusLost` events, `:checktime`, and `'autoread'`, which means that Vim will automatically pick up changes to files made by other processes.
* Sets up improved mouse support.
* Sets up Bracketed Paste support, for easy pasting (no more `'paste'` mode).
