title: Goodbye Prototype/Scriptaculous
tags: scriptaculous jquery prototype

[http://fukamachi.org/wp/2009/04/13/js-changeover/ Some lucky people] are able to rip out [[Prototype]] and [[Scriptaculous]] and replace them with [[jQuery]] in a single weekend.

I personally have had to [/issues/1278 work a little bit harder] &mdash; I started [/blog/switching-to-jquery back at the beginning of March] and have had half-done changes hanging around in my work tree since then &mdash; but it's finished at last!
