I've just released version 0.8 of the [Command-T](/wiki/Command-T) plug-in for [Vim](/wiki/Vim). This is a powerful, [open source](/wiki/open_source) file-navigation plug-in inspired by the "Command-T" feature in [TextMate](/wiki/TextMate).

This release includes a number of minor improvements, optimizations and bugfixes, but no new features since the [0.8b release](/blog/command-t-0.8b-released). A full change-log appears under HISTORY in [the documentation](http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/command-t.txt), and all commits in this release are listed [here](http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/shortlog/refs/tags/0.8).

If you're a [Vim](/wiki/Vim) user check out the [screencasts](/products/command-t) and give the plug-in a try. If you'd like to support development you can use [the donations page](/products/command-t/donations) to make a donation, or consider submitting a patch for the project (the source code can be browsed [here](http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git)).
