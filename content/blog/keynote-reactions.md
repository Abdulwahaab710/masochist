Gruber was wrong on just about [all counts](http://daringfireball.net/2007/01/macworld_expo_predictions), but I've got to admit that prior to the keynote I thought that most of his predictions were pretty spot on (note: I haven't actually watched the keynote yet, only read some textual coverage of it):

-   "New User Interface Theme to Replace Aqua in 10.5": I thought this was highly likely given Apple's move to resolution independence, and I still think it's likely for Leopard; I'm just wondering when Apple will be unveiling it.
-   "iPod Mobile Phone": Seems like most of the two hours were devoted to it. Looks wonderful, can't wait to get one. Just like the iPod, I think this is going to bring a whole heap of switchers over to the platform. This is more than an iPod, more than a phone: it's a computer that fits in your pocket.
-   "New MacBook Pro Form Factor": Didn't really expect any radical changes to the form factor.
-   "New Sub-Compact MacBook": I think there is a market for a sub-15" MacBook Pro and I would like to see one. The iPhone itself proves that Apple has the technology to make a computer as small as they want to.
-   "Absolutely Nothing That Involves the Word ‘Tablet’": Spot on, but the iPhone has many tablet-like qualities.
-   "iTV, Along With Apple-Branded Flat Screen TVs With iTV Built-In": Nope, I never expected Apple to release an Apple-branded TV. What I did expect to see, however, was a preview of some ultra-high-DPI displays. I still think we'll see these before Leopard ships. Once again, it's all about resolution independence.
-   "Dual Quad-Core Mac Pros": This one had my mouth watering but looks like we'll have to wait.
-   "Demo of Adobe Photoshop CS3 Beta": Nope, as far as I know.
-   "Roz Ho From Microsoft’s Mac BU": Again, nope.
-   "’07 Updates to the iWork and iLife suites": I expected this one and was a little disappointed not to see it.
-   "Higher-Speed AirPort Based on 802.11n": Partly true, as the Apple TV does indeed have faster AirPort.
-   "Absolutely Nothing That Involves the Phrase ‘Stock Options Backdating’": Of course.
