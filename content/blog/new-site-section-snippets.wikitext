title: New site section: snippets
tags: site
---
For a while now I've wanted to add a section to the site for publishing short snippets of text (see ticket #1436). This is for things that are:

* too long for a [/twitter tweet]
* not "on-topic" enough for a [/blog blog post]
* too transitory or ephemeral for a [/wiki wiki article] (eg. things of only transitory importance, like notes about something I'm working on)

So, we're talking here about something like the "pasties" you can post at http://pastie.org/, or the "gists" of http://gist.github.com/, but hosted here so that I get the usual benefits of integration with the rest of the site (easy searchability, linkability, taggability, commentability etc).

I finally got around to adding this and I'm calling them, logically, "snippets". My first publication in snippet form is [/snippets/1 this list of changes] included in the just-deployed update. Consistent with the other parts of the site, it's got syntax highlighting, tags, commenting, and there are [[Atom]] feeds that you can subscribe to to keep up-to-date:

* https://wincent.com/snippets.atom summarizes the latest snippets;
* and per-snippet feeds &mdash; like the one at https://wincent.com/snippets/1.atom &mdash; allow you to track when new comments are added to any given snippet

So from here on I should be able to keep the [/blog blog] much more focussed on "real news" and less cluttered with transitory notes and such.

As this is a new feature please let me know via the [[issue tracker]] or email to win@wincent.com if you spot any glitches.
