This is a tiny update to [[Wincent Strings Utility]], following on from the release of 2.0 [/blog/wincent-strings-utility-2.0-released yesterday]. The only significant change is that using the installer package on versions of [[Mac OS X]] older than 10.6 [[Snow Leopard]] will now trigger a dialog explaining the system version requirement. Also, the source distribution now includes the [[buildtools]] submodule so that it doesn't have to be fetched separately.

Wincent Strings Utility is a [[command-line]] tool designed to help developers with the task of localization. [http://wincent.com/a/products/wincent-strings-util/wincent-strings-util.1.txt This plaintext copy of the manpage] describes its different modes of operation.

This release will ''only'' run on [[Snow Leopard]], but older versions of the software which will work on older versions of [[Mac OS X]] are still available from [http://strings.wincent.com/ strings.wincent.com].
