Back in November last year I [posted](/blog/moving-to-the-cloud) about my decision to move from dedicated hosting to "[the cloud](/wiki/the_cloud)".

This post is just a little reminder that the move is coming up soon now, in February. I migrated the [DNS](/wiki/DNS) [back in November](/blog/dns-changes) and the outgoing mail ([SMTP](/wiki/SMTP)) was moved [at the same time](/blog/outgoing-mail-changes). More recently I've cancelled my contract with my old host, and am getting serious about preparing things at the [AWS](/wiki/AWS) end of things.

As with my last big move (from [Rackspace](/wiki/Rackspace) to [INetU](/wiki/INetU)) I'll be doing my best to keep downtime to a minimum (last time it was literally only a few minutes), so hopefully access to everything on the site should be next to uninterrupted.

In the meantime, keep your eye on this space for updates.
