title: Command-T 1.9.1 released
tags: releases command.t

There was a missing file in the release vimball archive of version 1.9 (which [/blog/command-t-1.9-released came out 5 days ago]). This release includes the missing file, but other than that there are no functional changes, so if things are working for you on 1.9 then there is no need to upgrade.

As an aside, it took 5 days for anybody to report the issue, which leads me to believe that very few people are actually using Vimball as an installation format nowadays. (Everyone is moving on to plug-in management tools like Pathogen, Vundle, Neobundle, VAM etc).

Anyway, for more details about 1.9, see [/blog/command-t-1.9-released the original blog post].
