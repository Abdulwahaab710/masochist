title: Stupid eBay Spain
tags: blog
---

A little over a month ago I sold something via eBay Spain and the winning bidder refused to pay. I went through the dispute process — dispute is "disputa" in Spanish — and after over a month of trying to get payment decided that it was fruitless to continue.

On trying to file my negative feedback for the buyer I was informed that my comment was disallowed because it contained a "prohibited word", but the anti-user interface did not inform me which word (or words). After trying various alternatives I found [this page](http://forums.es.ebay.com/thread.jspa?threadID=500005434&tstart=0&mod=1149852844791) which reveals the answer: the word "disputa" (eBay's own terminology) is disallowed because it contains the string, "puta", which means "whore" in Spanish. Way to go, eBay. Way to go.
