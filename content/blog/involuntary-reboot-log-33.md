Haven't seen one like this for a while: a simple freeze in which absolutely everything stopped (no hard drive noise, no pointer movement). After waiting for a few minutes I did a hard reset.

-   Kernel panics: 11
-   Hard resets: 22
-   Total failures: 33
-   Start of recording keeping: 21 May 2006
-   Total days to date: 753 days
-   Average time between failures: 22.81 days
