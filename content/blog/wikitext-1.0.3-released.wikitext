title: Wikitext 1.0.3 released
tags: wikitext
---
I just pushed out a minor maintenance release of my [[wikitext]] module, version 1.0.3. [[Wikitext]] is a fast wikitext-to-[[HTML]] translator with a syntax very close to that used by [[MediaWiki]]. It is a [[Ruby]] extension written with speed and robustness in mind using a [[Ragel]]-generated scanner and a hand-coded parser, all in [[C]]. It has an enormous spec suite.

You can browse the source code repo [http://git.wincent.com/wikitext.git here], or download the [[gem]] from the [[RubyForge]] [http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=5483 downloads page]. For an overview check out the [[RDoc]] [http://wikitext.rubyforge.org/ here]. After a few hours it should propagate out to the mirrors and you'll be able to install it with `sudo gem install wikitext`.
