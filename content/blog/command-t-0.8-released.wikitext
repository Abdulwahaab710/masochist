I've just released version 0.8 of the [[Command-T]] plug-in for [[Vim]]. This is a powerful, [[open source]] file-navigation plug-in inspired by the "Command-T" feature in [[TextMate]].

This release includes a number of minor improvements, optimizations and bugfixes, but no new features since the [/blog/command-t-0.8b-released 0.8b release]. A full change-log appears under HISTORY in [http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/command-t.txt the documentation], and all commits in this release are listed [http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/shortlog/refs/tags/0.8 here].

If you're a [[Vim]] user check out the [/products/command-t screencasts] and give the plug-in a try. If you'd like to support development you can use [/products/command-t/donations the donations page] to make a donation, or consider submitting a patch for the project (the source code can be browsed [http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git here]).
