title: What I hate about the Mac OS X panic dialog
tags: blog

The wording:

![](/system/images/legacy/panic_dialog.png)

> You need to restart your computer. Hold down the Power button for several seconds or press the Restart button.

No admission of fatal errors, no confession of failure, no reference to "panic", "quitting", "bailing" or "giving up", no indication of fault. Just the dry, matter-of-fact statement that you need to restart your computer — and "restart" is such a bland, innocuous word, totally unbefitting of the cold, harsh reality of a the hard, rough, scraping-against-the-metal reset that awaits you — eliding all blame and reference to the damage to your filesystem that such a hard reset will almost inevitably inflict (despite your journaled file system).

At least the Window Blue Screen of Death is honest.
