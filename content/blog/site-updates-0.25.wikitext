Just deployed some updates to the site ([/snippets/9 full change list here]). Most of these changes are part of the integrated [[Git]] [/repos repo browsing] functionality (nothing to see there yet as I haven't yet configured any repos, but most of the groundwork is now laid) but there are a couple of user-visible fixes and enhancements:

* [Fix]: Restore missing submit button in new topic form
* [Enhancement]: Use [[CSS]] to highlight "active fragment" if URL includes a fragment (for example, when linking to [/comments/6341 a comment], the comment gets highlighted)
