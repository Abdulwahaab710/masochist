Version 4.4b2 of [[Synergy]], the lightweight, highly-customizable [[iTunes]] controller, has just been released for beta testing. The 4.0 series is a brand new line of development especially for [[Mac OS X]] 10.6 [[Snow Leopard]].

This is a minor feature release which adds new preferences for controlling notification bezels in response to Hot Key actions. This second beta replaces the previous Amazon access credentials used to enable cover art downloads.

Note that the 4.0 series will ''only'' run on [[Snow Leopard]]. (Version 3.4.1, the last release in the stable series will run on all versions of Mac OS X from 10.2.8 upwards.) A full changelog appears [/products/synergy/history here].

For many users this release will be a free upgrade: see [/blog/synergy-4.0-upgrades this blog post] to find out whether you qualify. If you got Synergy through the MacHeist Giving Tree bundle see  [/blog/frequently-asked-questions-about-synergy-and-macheist the MacHeist FAQ].
