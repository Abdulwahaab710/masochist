title: Git repo mirrors

I've just set up a couple of [[Git]] repository mirrors for my [[open source]] projects.

The ''authoritative, official'' repositories continue to be hosted at [http://git.wincent.com/ git.wincent.com].

But now there are ''mirror, backup'' repositories hosted at:

* http://gitorious.org/~wincent; and
* http://github.com/wincent/

Changes are automatically pushed out from the authoritative repo to the backup/mirror repos on an hourly basis.

The sheer flexibility of [[distributed version control]], and the ability to trivially set up mirrors like this, is really fantastic.

For the curious, here are some notes I made on the process:

* [[Setting up backup (mirror) repositories on GitHub]]
* [[Setting up backup (mirror) repositories on Gitorious]]
