[Well said](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/10/05.html):

> But really it's just a desperate desire to be like Apple, without even a smidgen of understanding of the culture code that makes Designed by Apple in California work. It's not even clear that anyone at Microsoft would understand that there is such a thing as a culture code, although they are to be forgiven for not reading important books by French intellectuals. After all, they're in Seattle and it's raining.
