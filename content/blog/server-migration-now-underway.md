title: Server migration now underway

The server migration (previously mentioned [here](/blog/server-migration-coming-up-in-february)) is now in progress and will be fully completed by 20 February. As usual, I'll be doing my best to ensure that all services are subject to minimal downtime, but it is possible that you'll encounter some instability over the next few days.

I'll be posting status updates to the twitter feed that you can see to the right of the [blog](/blog) or on the [main twitter index page](/twitter).
