title: Wikitext 1.1.1 released
tags: wikitext
---
I just uploaded a minor maintenance release of my [[wikitext]] module, version 1.1.1, whose sole change is a fix for the breakage caused by [[API]] changes in [[Rails]] 2.1.0_RC1.

[[Wikitext]] is a fast wikitext-to-[[HTML]] translator with a syntax very close to that used by [[MediaWiki]]. It is a [[Ruby]] extension written with speed and robustness in mind using a [[Ragel]]-generated scanner and a hand-coded parser, all in [[C]]. It has an enormous spec suite.

You can browse the source code repo [http://git.wincent.com/wikitext.git here], or download the [[gem]] from the [[RubyForge]] [http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=5483 downloads page]. For an overview check out the [[RDoc]] [http://wikitext.rubyforge.org/ here]. If you have [[RubyGems]] then you can install it with `sudo gem install wikitext`, although it may take some time for the new release to propagate out to all the gem mirrors.
