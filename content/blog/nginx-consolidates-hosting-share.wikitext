Just saw last month's [http://netcraft.com/ Netcraft] web server survey and was pleased to see that [[nginx]] has cemented it's fifth-place spot with a solid 2.4 million hosts in ([http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2008/08/29/august_2008_web_server_survey.html survey link]). This is of interest to me because nginx is the [[HTTP]] server that powers this site (at least, the new [[Rails]]-backed portions of the site).
