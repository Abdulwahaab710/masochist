[https://github.com/wincent/loupe Loupe] is a small [[Vim]] plug-in that I just extracted from [https://github.com/wincent/wincent my dotfiles].

It enhances the in-file search experience in Vim in a few ways:

* Makes the current match easier to see by highlighting it differently and keeping it centered
* Makes "very magic" pattern syntax the default
* Provides a shortcut for removing search highlighting
* Sets sensible defaults for Vim's search-related settings

'''Note:''' This isn't intended to be feature-competitive with something like [https://github.com/haya14busa/incsearch.vim incsearch.vim]. This is lightweight and minimal, and contains the small set of features that I've built up over time while tweaking my Vim set-up.
