I've just launched [piratewatch.org](http://piratewatch.org/), a developer community with one goal: to share information to help one another to efficiently combat piracy. It's an idea I've been mulling over for a while; that pirates have turned "sharing" into a fine art and that perhaps we would do well to use their own weapon against them. By sharing knowledge we leverage each other's experiences and know-how to make our anti-piracy efforts more effective. I'm hoping this will mean that we can all spend less time combatting piracy but with greater benefit, and the end result will be that we have more time to work on features that our paying users will appreciate.

If you are a developer I encourage you to [head on over now](http://piratewatch.org/) and join in.
