[Synergy](/wiki/Synergy) version 6.0a4 is out, containing another fix for a crash ([bug \#2173](/issues/2173)). 6.0a2 and 6.0a3 were trying to fix the same crash and each version has gotten a little better; I'm hoping this one is the definitive fix.

See [the 6.0a release announcement](/blog/synergy-6.0a-release) for more details about what's new in 6.0.
