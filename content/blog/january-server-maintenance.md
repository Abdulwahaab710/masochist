The server will shortly be going down (at roughly 10 AM EST, Tuesday 6 January 2009) for routine maintenance. Expected downtime should be approximately half an hour.

**Update:** The server is now back online. In the end, downtime was less than two minutes because the anticipated automatic file-system check didn't take place.
