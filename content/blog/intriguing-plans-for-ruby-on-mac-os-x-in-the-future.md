title: Intriguing plans for Ruby on Mac OS X in the future
tags: blog

It will probably be a long, long time before this comes to fruit, but Laurent Sansonetti has made [these](http://chopine.be/lrz/diary/2007-11-06_RubyConf-2007.html) very interesting comments:

> At the end of the talk, I spoke about some of the future plans regarding Ruby on Mac OS X, which consists of basing the Ruby interpreter class model on top of the Objective-C runtime, to eliminate all the bridging problems. I discussed this with Matz and Koichi, and it is great to hear that they are positive about this effort. The objective wouldn't be to rewrite Ruby again, neither to brutally fork the code base, but to work with the Ruby core team and try to figure out a nice integration. I will write more about this soon.
