The [forums](http://forums.wincent.com/) are now back online again, now on the new server. All of the members, threads and posts have been transferred across from the old server. The [bug and feature requests database](http://bugs.wincent.com/) is also online -- in fact it was one of the first things to go back into service -- and the new, improved mailing lists page is up at [lists.wincent.com](http://lists.wincent.com/) (although there are still a few more lists to be added to it). There are still a few pages to be updated but pretty much everything seems to have come across smoothly. I will try to transfer the subscribers from the old lists but if I am unable to do so I will post an announcement here advising people of the need to resubscribe.
