title: Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit

I noticed that some of my [[Git]] repos give me nice status messages like "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit" whenever I do a `git status` while others do not.

I think it's because some of them weren't originally clones and had their "remote" configuration set up manually, but not completely in the way that you get when you run `git clone` with a recent version of Git. Whatever the cause was, here's the fix.

Here's a section of the `.git/config` file for a clone which does display the additional status information:

<pre>[remote "origin"]
	url = git://github.com/rentzsch/mogenerator.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "master"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/master</pre>

And here's the equivalent config for a repo which doesn't show the status information:

<pre>[remote "origin"]
	url = git://github.com/rentzsch/mogenerator.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</pre>

The fix? Add the required info using `git config`:

 $ git config branch.master.remote origin
 $ git config branch.master.merge refs/heads/master
