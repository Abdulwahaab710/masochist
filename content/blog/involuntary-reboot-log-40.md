title: Involuntary Reboot Log #40
tags: involuntary.reboot.log blog

Another unattended [kernel panic](/wiki/kernel_panic), this time with the screensaver password prompt visible on screen and the standard kernel panic text overlaid on top of that. This is running from the external backup disk because the internal drive seems to be irrecoverably hosed (won't accept copies after formatting), so I'm definitely concerned about the precariousness of the system.
