The release candidate for [Synergy](http://synergy.wincent.com/) 2.3 has just been released. The new version features some major architectural changes; Synergy is now a Universal Binary that can run natively on both Intel and PowerPC processors. A full changelog appears [here](http://www.wincent.com/a/products/synergy-classic/history/).

The release has already been seeded to beta testers. If you wish to participate in the testing effort you can download the release candidate [from here](http://www.wincent.com/download.php?item=Synergy2.3.dmg) and report any bugs or issues that you might find [here](http://bugs.wincent.com/) (but remember to do a [search first](http://www.wincent.com/a/support/bugs/query.cgi)). The current, stable release (version 2.2) continues to be available for download [from here](http://www.wincent.com/download.php?item=Synergy.dmg).
