[Loupe](https://github.com/wincent/loupe) is a small [Vim](/wiki/Vim) plug-in that I just extracted from [my dotfiles](https://github.com/wincent/wincent).

It enhances the in-file search experience in Vim in a few ways:

-   Makes the current match easier to see by highlighting it differently and keeping it centered
-   Makes "very magic" pattern syntax the default
-   Provides a shortcut for removing search highlighting
-   Sets sensible defaults for Vim's search-related settings

**Note:** This isn't intended to be feature-competitive with something like [incsearch.vim](https://github.com/haya14busa/incsearch.vim). This is lightweight and minimal, and contains the small set of features that I've built up over time while tweaking my Vim set-up.
