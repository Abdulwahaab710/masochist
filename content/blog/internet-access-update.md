Just received notification that the Alfa AWUS036H I [ordered](/blog/internet-access-problems) last Wednesday has arrived in Madrid and is waiting to be picked up from the post office. I'm quite impressed that it only took a week to get here; I'd have it already if I had been in when they tried to deliver it.

I can't pick it up today because it's a public holiday here, but I am sincerely hoping that tomorrow I'll have my development machine back online again. Fingers crossed that the wireless gods smile upon me and I can actually get a signal...

**Update (2 days later):** No luck yet. The Alfa does definitely have better sensitivity (I can see more networks), but not enough to see my provider's network. I'll continue to experiment and perhaps try out another kind of antenna, but if I can't find the solution this week then I'll have to switch providers, I think.
