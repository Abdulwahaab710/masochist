title: Wikitext in the wild
tags: wikitext

I've never really known how many people use my [[wikitext]] extension, but today I got my first ever feature request for it! (If you're curious, you can check out the request in ticket #1268.)

So I have a user!

My curiosity was piqued. I decided to hit [[Google]] and see if I could find any other evidence of use.

= Sightings in the wild =

At this stage I've managed to stumble across three sightings:

* First up I found [http://github.com/jchupp/hoboken/tree/master Hoboken] by Jeffrey Chupp; it's a simple [[wiki]] built using Sinatra that requires wikitext
* There's also the [http://www.viget.com/extend/introducing-actsasmarkup-a-markdown-textile-wikitext-and-rdoc-plugin/ ActsAsMarkup] project, an ActiveRecord plug-in by Brian Landau that supports wikitext as one of the possible markup formats
* Finally, I found [http://github.com/stephenjudkins/ruby-wikitext/tree/master this GitHub fork] by Stephen Judkins, which currently has [http://github.com/stephenjudkins/ruby-wikitext/watchers 5 followers] (including me and the original forker, the "mother forker" if you will)

It's that last one which had me most surprised, because you can see there's a guy by the name of [http://github.com/RobotDeathSquad BJ Clark] that actually took the time to understand the parser (about 2,500 lines of [[C]]) and produce [http://github.com/stephenjudkins/ruby-wikitext/commit/e768034b66bebb61c66d5c78d7579b218ecd11e5 this commit].
