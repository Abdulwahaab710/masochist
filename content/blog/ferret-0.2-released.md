I just cut version 0.2 of [Ferret](https://github.com/wincent/ferret), which adds `FerretDidWrite` and `FerretWillWrite` autocommands, and a mapping for bringing up `:Acks` with the last search term pre-populated.

For more info on Ferret, see [the original release announcement](/blog/ferret-0.1-released) or [the README](https://github.com/wincent/ferret).
