title: Wikitext 2.0 released
tags: releases wikitext
---
A major new version of the [[Wikitext]] gem, version 2.0, is now available. This release offers full support for [[Rails]] 3 (while retaining support for Rails 2) and conforms fully to the new HTML5 specification (while maintaining backwards compatibility with HTML4/XHTML).

= New features in 2.0 =

== Full support for Rails 3 ==

* compatibility with the Rails 3 template handler [[API]]
* use of Rails 3 "hooks" to auto-initialize when listed in the Gemfile

== HTML5 compliance ==

* all output is now a valid HTML5 fragment (while retaining compliance with HTML4/XHTML)
* while `<tt>` tags may still be used in the ''input'', we no longer ''emit'' `<tt>` tags in the ''output'' (`<tt>` was removed from HTML5); we instead output `<code>` tags
* explicit support for the two HTML5 output syntaxes, HTML (the new default) and XML (available via the new `output_style` setting)

= About the extension =

[[Wikitext]] is a fast wikitext-to-[[HTML]] translator with a syntax very close to that used by [[MediaWiki]]. It is a [[Ruby]] extension written with speed and robustness in mind using a [[Ragel]]-generated [http://git.wincent.com/wikitext.git/blob/HEAD:/ext/wikitext_ragel.rl scanner] and an extremely fast [http://git.wincent.com/wikitext.git/blob/HEAD:/ext/parser.c hand-coded parser], all in [[C]]. It has an enormous [http://git.wincent.com/wikitext.git/tree/HEAD:/spec spec suite].

You can browse the source code repo [http://git.wincent.com/wikitext.git here], or download the [[gem]] from the [http://rubygems.org/gems/wikitext rubygems.org downloads page]. For an overview of how to use the extension check out the [[RDoc]] [http://wikitext.rubyforge.org/ here]. If you have [[RubyGems]] then you can install it with either `gem install wikitext` or `sudo gem install wikitext`.
