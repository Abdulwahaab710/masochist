I originally posted [this article](http://www.wincent.com/a/knowledge-base/archives/2006/01/security_notes.php) here ([my personal weblog](http://www.wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/)) by mistake. I've [now moved it](http://www.wincent.com/a/knowledge-base/archives/2006/01/security_notes.php) to the [Knowledge Base](http://www.wincent.com/a/knowledge-base/) where it should have been all along.
