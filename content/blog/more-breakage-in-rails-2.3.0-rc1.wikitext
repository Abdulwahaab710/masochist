The update to Rails 2.3.0 RC1 was deceptively quiet. It looked like everything went smoothly, and all the specs kept passing with very few of the adjustments I'm used to having to perform when updating Rails.

But as time goes by more and more subtle issues start to come out of the cracks. I [https://wincent.com/blog/rails-update-headaches wrote about] some of the issues a week ago. The latest is [http://rails.lighthouseapp.com:80/projects/8994/tickets/2039 this] subtle but important breakage in the routing code. I'm actually quite glad that I started doing this local testing early, so as to allow time for all this insidious code-churn-induced bustage to bubble up to the surface and hopefully be fixed.

= Update: 8 hours later =

Just found [http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/2043 even more bustage].

= Update: 1 March 2009 =

And [http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/2108 more].
