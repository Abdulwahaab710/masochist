title: Command-T 1.1b and 1.1b2 released
tags: releases command.t
---
Only a few days ago we hit the one-year anniversary of the first public release of [[Command-T]] for [[Vim]]. And to celebrate, I've just released version 1.1b2 of the plug-in. This is a powerful, [[open source]] file and buffer-navigation plug-in inspired by the "Command-T" feature in [[TextMate]].

= What's changed since [/blog/command-t-1.0.1-released the 1.0.1 release] =

This is a minor feature release which adds the ability to search among any open buffers. You can bring up the buffer listing with `:CommandTBuffer`. It is also bound to `<Leader>b` by default (although that mapping won't override any pre-existing mapping that you might have for `<Leader>b`).

As always, a full change-log appears under HISTORY in [http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/blob/1.1b2:/README.txt the documentation], and you can explore the commits in the release [/repos/command-t/tags/1.1b2 here]. (Note: the integrated repository browser that I'm linking to here is still relatively new and doesn't have a full feature set yet. You may prefer to view the commits in [http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/shortlog/refs/tags/1.1b2 the old GitWeb repository browser] in the meantime.)

(Note there were actually two releases in quick succession here, 1.1b and 1.1b2, although in both cases the actual plug-in code is identical. I had made significant changes to the scripts I use to automate the release process, and I needed to make one additional tweak after 1.1b went out, requiring me to run the release scripts one more time and produce 1.1b2.)

= Installation =

Command-T is a combination of C, Ruby and Vim's built-in scripting language, which means that you need not only Ruby and a suitable C compiler on your system, but you also have to make sure you use compatible versions. That is, you can't link your Vim against Ruby 1.9.2 and Command-T against Ruby 1.8.7 without things going "Boom!". For some reason, people ''love'' playing with different Ruby versions, via [[RVM]] and other means, and this has generated no small number of tickets in the [[issue tracker]].

Windows is the worst platform of all, unsurprisingly. Getting Ruby, Vim and Command-T working together on Windows is similar in difficulty to transmuting lead into gold; if anything, transmuting may be easier.

So, if you're unfortunate enough to be using Windows, or if you're the sort that likes to play with different versions of Ruby, all I can do is encourage you to read [http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/README.txt the documentation] very, very carefully &mdash; I've done my best to make it accurate and comprehensive &mdash; stick to the recommended, known-working versions, and maybe watch the installation screencasts on [/products/command-t the Command-T product page].

== [[Pathogen]] users ==

<pre lang="shell">$ cd path/to/your/pathogen/bundle # probably ~/.vim/bundle
$ git clone git://git.wincent.com/command-t.git
$ cd command-t
$ rake make</pre>

And in Vim:

 :call pathogen#helptags()

See [http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/README.txt the docs] for more info on installing (and updating) Command-T via Pathogen.

== Everybody else ==

* Download the vimball from [/products/command-t the Command-T product page] (or [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3025 www.vim.org], if you prefer)
* Open the vimball archive in vim, and do `:so %` to unpack it
* `cd ~/.vim/ruby/command-t && ruby extconf.rb && make`

= Screencasts, donations and source code =

If you're a [[Vim]] user check out the [/products/command-t screencasts] and give the plug-in a try. If you'd like to support development you can use [/products/command-t/donations the donations page] to make a donation, or consider submitting a patch for the project (the source code can be browsed [/repos/command-t here]).
