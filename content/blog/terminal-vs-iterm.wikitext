title: Terminal vs iTerm
tags:

In a directory with a bunch of source files, `time cat *.{m,h}` in iTerm yields:

<pre>real    0m2.585s
user    0m0.010s
sys     0m0.034s</pre>

While the [[Mac OS X]] [[Terminal]] (10.5.8) gives:

<pre>real	0m0.235s
user	0m0.010s
sys	0m0.031s</pre>

Shame, seeing as unlike the Terminal, iTerm actually has non-[/twitter/157 broken tab titles]. Looks like I am going to have to try out [http://pseudogreen.org/blog/set_tab_names_in_leopard_terminal.html this ghastly hack].

Wonder if [[Apple]] has fixed this in [[Snow Leopard]]... The [[AppleScript]] dictionary at least suggests that this kind of thing is ''supposed'' to work:

<pre>tell application "Terminal"
	set title displays custom title of first tab of first window to true
	set custom title of first tab of first window to "foo"
end tell</pre>

But it doesn't modify the tab title, only the window title.

Used the "ghastly hack" mentioned above as a basis for [http://git.wincent.com/wincent.git/commitdiff/f8a8493f12c726bc641be43b5973adb6d6348222 this]. Note that it's not so much the hack itself that is "ghastly" as the fact that Apple could release a tab implementation with such a horrid usability flaw.
