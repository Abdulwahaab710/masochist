Here's another great entry for the famous "Involuntary Reboot Log". I left home tonight at about 11:30 PM and left the computer running. When I got home at 3:00 AM it was literally roaring like a hot air blow dryer and the screen was blank. It wouldn't respond to mouse movements, key presses, or pings. Had to hard reset. Must've done wonders for the thing to be flogging its guts out like that for goodness knows how long (or why). So now, the annoying data consistency checks and Disk First Aid runs.
