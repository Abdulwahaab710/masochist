This is a bugfix release that contains a couple of fixes ([one for Windows compatibility](https://github.com/wincent/command-t/commit/7a0a5c204eecb97b956eb69bd5436b7385253ac8) and [another to better handle a rare edge case](https://github.com/wincent/command-t/commit/9a2653bc91be13b810e63a394574277192927e5d)). Most users weren't affected by these issues, but if you were, you'll want to upgrade.
