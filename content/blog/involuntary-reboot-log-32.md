Another kernel panic, less than 10 minutes after the last one. Again while mounting/dismounting disk images. This takes me back to the OS 9 days, when you would work in constant fear of losing your data, aware that any click could send the operating system bombing.

Well, I guess that settles it: I'm not going to be shipping any more products using disk images. It's zip from here on in. I can't really afford the time or the risk to my data of having to work with disk images any more.
