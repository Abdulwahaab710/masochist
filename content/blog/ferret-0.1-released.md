[Ferret](https://github.com/ferret) is another [Vim](/wiki/Vim) plug-in I've extracted from [my dotfiles](https://github.com/wincent/wincent), following hot on the heels of [Terminus](/blog/terminus-0.1-released), [Loupe](/blog/loupe-0.1-released), and [vim-clipper](/blog/vim-clipper-0.1-released).

While [Loupe](https://github.com/loupe) enhances within-file search in Vim, Ferret enhances multi-file search:

-   Multi-file search via `ag`, `ack` or `grep` using the `:Ack` and `:Lack` commands
-   Multi-file replace via `:Acks`
-   Quickfix listing enhancements for better usability (deletion mappings, enhanced `:cn`, `:cnf` and friends, optimized settings)
-   A `:Qargs` command for performing bulk operations on files in the quickfix listing
