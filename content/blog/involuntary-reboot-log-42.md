title: Involuntary Reboot Log #42
tags: involuntary.reboot.log blog
---

Another [kernel panic](/wiki/kernel_panic), this time on application launch (the same app has now kernel panicked three times on me). With this failure the venerable iMac smashes (downwards) through the 20-day barrier for "time between failures".

-   Kernel panics: 18
-   Hard resets: 24
-   Total failures: 42
-   Start of recording keeping: 21 May 2006
-   Total days to date: 836 days
-   Average time between failures: 19.905 days
