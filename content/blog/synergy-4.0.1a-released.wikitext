[[Synergy]], the lightweight, highly-customizable [[iTunes]] controller has been updated to version 4.0.1a, especially for [[Mac OS X]] 10.6 [[Snow Leopard]].

This is the latest release in the alpha/experimental series and represents the cutting-edge of development. It will ''only'' run on [[Snow Leopard]]. (Version 3.4, the last release in the stable series will run on all versions of Mac OS X from 10.2.8 upwards.) A full changelog appears [/products/synergy/history here].
