**Q:** Why write yet another HOM implementation when there are already so many out there?

**A:** Because it's not the sort of code I would want to use without understanding exactly how it worked; and the best way of fully understanding it was to write it myself. And as always, when you write something yourself you can tailor it exactly to suit your specific needs.

**Q:** Will you release the source?

**A:** Doesn't seem to be much point to that given the number of existing implementations already out there to from which to choose.

**Q:** Do you think your implementation is better than any existing implementations?

**A:** Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. It's better for me because it fits with my coding style, was designed to meet my own personal criteria, and gives me exactly what I need, no more, no less. I am also convinced of it's quality in a way that I cannot be of other frameworks because I have written and understood every line of code that went into it, written the speed and unit tests, and have a high degree of confidence in the coverage of the tests.
