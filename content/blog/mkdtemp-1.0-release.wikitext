title: mkdtemp 1.0 release
tags: mkdtemp

mkdtemp is a tiny little [[RubyGem]] that I use whenever I need to securely create temporary files or directories in [[Ruby]]. I've used it several times over the years, and the source code has been publicly available for some time, but it's only now that I've actually published it as a gem for the first time.

From the docs, mkdtemp:

<blockquote>securely creates temporary directories. It is a wrapper for the mkdtemp() function in the standard C library.</blockquote>
