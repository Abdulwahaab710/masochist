title: Subversion repository maintenance

The Wincent public Subversion repository will be going down for maintenance shortly. The planned maintenance consists of shutting down the server, dumping all repository contents, performing the upgrade to the newly released version 1.4.0, reloading the repositories, and restarting the server. The purpose of the dump/reload cycle is to take advantage of the more compact repository storage format introduced with 1.4.0.

**Update:** The maintenance is now complete and the public repository is back online.
