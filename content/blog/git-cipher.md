A few days ago I released [git-cipher](https://github.com/wincent/git-cipher), a tool for storing encrypted content in Git. It provides a convenient command-line interface for encrypting and decrypting, and your sensitive content appears in the Git repo [like this](https://github.com/wincent/wincent/blob/c1d1469abafd0066e6469c4b693cafb99fb9e041/roles/ssh/files/.ssh_config.encrypted).

Head over and checkout [the README](https://github.com/wincent/git-cipher) for more details.
