[It's just too good](http://www.smartsvn.com/smartsvn/index.jsp). After trialing it for about a week I purchased a license. It mops the floor with Xcode's Subversion support and allows me to do version control operations much faster than I could in the terminal. In general it makes so many things so easy that I find myself doing more with Subversion than I used to before.
