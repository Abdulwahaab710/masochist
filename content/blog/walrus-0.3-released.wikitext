title: Walrus 0.3 released
tags: walrus releases
---
Version 0.3 of the [[Walrus]] gem has just been released. Walrus is an [[object-oriented templating]] system written in [[Ruby]] and heavily inspired by the [[Cheetah template engine]] (which is written in [[Python]]). It doesn't set out to be a full clone of Cheetah, but it does implement a very large subset of its functionality, and it employs the same directive syntax wherever possible.

For over 3 years now, Walrus has been powered by its own sophisticated, embedded "[[packrat]]" parser generator. The generator has at last been extracted into a separate gem called [[Walrat]] for ease of use in other projects (see [/blog/walrat-0.1-released the release announcement]). Version 0.3 of Walrus is the first release without the embedded parser generator, and instead depends on Walrat as an external dependency.
