Some nervous moments.

Just had a couple of momentary power cuts, brown-outs I guess you could call them, that lasted for a fraction of a second. The [UPS](/wiki/UPS) rode through the first one, but let me down on the second one with a hard shutdown (no idea why, it's usually been pretty good up until now).

But the story doesn't end there; the machine was dead like a slab of rock for several minutes and wouldn't power up. I was fearful that it had been fried. After many repeated attempts, power cycling the UPS a few times, and unplugging and plugging back in, my machine finally deigned to reboot. Thank goodness, as I can't really afford for it to go down right now in the middle of a server move.
