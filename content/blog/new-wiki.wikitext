The new [[wiki]] is the first part of the updated site that's ready for action. All &mdash; well, ''almost'' all &mdash; of the content has been migrated across from the wiki on the old server. You can view it by clicking the "Wiki" link in the navigation bar that you see across the top of every page.

In addition, a static mirror of the pages on the old [[MediaWiki]] installation can be found [http://kbase.wincent.com/old/ here]. Being a static mirror, all of the dynamic links are inactive and the search box now depends on [[Google]]. And as I write this, Google hasn't yet noticed the kbase.wincent.com domain and started indexing it, so perhaps the most useful page of all for finding pages on the static mirror is the [http://kbase.wincent.com/old/knowledge-base/Special:Allpages.html "All pages" listing].

If you compare any given page on the static mirror with the corresponding page in the new [[wiki]] you'll see that the export/import worked fairly well. Here's an example article selected at random:

* Old: [http://kbase.wincent.com/old/knowledge-base/Upgrading_to_Bugzilla_3.0.1.html Upgrading to Bugzilla 3.0.1]
* New: [[Upgrading to Bugzilla 3.0.1]]

This is largely due to the fact that the [[wikitext]] markup used by the new [[website]] is almost identical to that used by [[MediaWiki]]. There ''are'' some minor glitches on some of the pages and the old MediaWiki categories don't always translate very well into "[[Web 2.0]]"-style [[tags]], but on the whole the [[wiki]] migration went very well. If you spot a problem with an article please let me know at win@wincent.com and I'll get it sorted out.
