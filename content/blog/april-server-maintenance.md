Will shortly be rebooting the server for some routine maintenance. Downtime is expected to be no more than a couple of minutes.

**Update:** The reboot has now been completed. I made some notes on the maintenance process in [Updating the kernel from version 2.6.18-92.1.17.el5 to 2.6.18-128.1.6.el5 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.1](/wiki/Updating_the_kernel_from_version_2.6.18-92.1.17.el5_to_2.6.18-128.1.6.el5_on_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_5.1).
