title: Involuntary Reboot Log #35, #36, #37, #38 and #39

I've been too disappointed with this machine of late to post new entries to the [[involuntary reboot log]], but now that [[HFS+]] has failed me yet again and I'm waiting for [[SuperDuper!]] to finish restoring my boot volume (second time it's saved my skin) I may as well post this update. There are over 1.5 million files to be restored so I expect I'll be here twiddling my thumbs for quite some time.

Since the last log entry and over the last month I've had 3 [[kernel panics]] and 2 [[hard resets]], so the reliability of the machine is definitely declining. The average time between failures over the lifetime over the machine is now at 20 days, down from an initial 30 days when the machine was younger, but if we take the average over a shorter time frame the number drops down to a mere 6 or 7 days, which places it in Windows 98 territory, more or less.

Now more than ever I am hoping that my finances will permit purchasing a new machine before the end of the year (if this one even lasts that long).

* Kernel panics: 15
* Hard resets: 24
* Total failures: 39
* Start of recording keeping: 21 May 2006
* Total days to date: 807 days
* Average time between failures: 20.69 days
