title: Rackspace factoids
---

I got a Christmas card and some calendar cards from my webhost, [Rackspace](http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=30735717&siteid=41506187&bfpage=hosting_headaches). On the calendar cards are printed a series of factoids (I say "factoids" because I can't verify their veracity, although I trust Rackspace so I think they're most likely to be true); I found these ones to be of interest:

-   50% of our business is by [direct referral](http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=30735717&siteid=41506187&bfpage=hosting_headaches)
-   We answer all support calls within 5-seconds \[sic\]
-   We host 1% of the Internet
-   We have more level-3 RedHat engineers than any other hosting company
