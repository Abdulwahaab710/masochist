I'm belatedly announcing the release of version 0.3 of the [[Wopen3]] gem. It was actually released a couple of weeks ago but I somehow overlooked posting an official announcement here.

Wopen3 is a replacement for Open3 in the [[Ruby]] standard library. Unlike Open3, Wopen3 does not throw away the exit status of the executed (grandchild) process. Only a child process it spawned and the exit status is returned in `$?` as normal.

This is a minor feature release which adds a new `success?` method to the `Wopen3::Result` instance that is returned by the `system` method. It's used as shown here:

<pre lang="ruby">result = Wopen3.system('git', 'log')
result.status   # => 0
result.success? #Â => true
result.stderr   # => ''
result.stdout   # => 'commit 491411b3...'</pre>

The full list of changes can be viewed [http://git.wincent.com/wopen3.git/shortlog/refs/tags/0.3 here], and the new version can be installed via `sudo gem install wopen3`.
