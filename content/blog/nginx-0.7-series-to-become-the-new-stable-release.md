Igor Sysoev, the maintainer of [nginx](/wiki/nginx), has [just posted](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.nginx.english/12430) to the mailing list:

> I'm going to branch 0.8 development version and mark 0.7 as stable on this or the next week.

So looks like the jump from the 0.6 series will be in order soon.
