title: Old rails.wincent.com links

If you have any bookmarks pointing at rails.wincent.com, now would be a good time to update them to point at wincent.com instead.

For some time (many months) an automatic redirect has been in place that forwards visitors from rails.wincent.com to wincent.com.

More recently the SSL certificate for rails.wincent.com expired and I have no plans to renew it.

I will eventually deactivate the rails.wincent.com domain entirely, so I recommend you update any old bookmarks that you may have pointing at it now.
