I am about to power-cycle the server in order to apply a kernel update. Downtime is only expected to be a few minutes.

'''Update:''' The machine is now back up. Downtime was approximately 2 minutes 17 seconds. Notes on the process can be found [[Updating the kernel from version 2.6.18-128.1.6.el5 to 2.6.18-128.4.1.el5 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3|here]].
