title: Walrus Git repository moved
tags: walrus

Just a minor note. The [[Walrus]] [[Git]] repository is now at:

* http://git.wincent.com/walrus.git ([[web]]-based repository browser)
* git://git.wincent.com/walrus.git ([[Git]] clone [[URL]])

This is just a case change (from `Walrus.git` to `walrus.git`), for consistency with the other projects hosted on git.wincent.com. I'll be updating any online references to the repository that I can; if you find a bad link pointing to the old address, please let me know (win@wincent.com).
