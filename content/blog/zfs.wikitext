Just looked back over some words I wrote in 2007 (emphasis added):

<blockquote>[[Apple]] currently (with [[Mac OS X]] [[Tiger]]) provides a journaled filesystem in the form of HFS+, but I have had multiple catastrophic failures of HFS+ volumes, both when used independently and when configured as a software RAID, so I cannot recommend HFS+ for use with any data that you aren't prepared to throw away. HFS+ is effectively a "throwaway filesystem".

In [[Leopard]] Apple will support [[ZFS]] which is a revolutionary filesystem developed by [[Sun]]. It supports journaling, advanced RAID, and unparalleled data integrity verification and self-repair. [[Apple]] has publicly stated that ZFS support will be read-only at first, but '''we can definitely hope for and look forward to read/write access and bootability from ZFS in the future.'''</blockquote>

Still sad about this, and still mostly unimpressed with HFS+, although Apple ''has'' made some nice improvements in the form of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Storage Core Storage] and a much-improved, whole-disk [[File Vault]] implementation.

Will we ever see ZFS or anything comparable on OS X? It's pretty clearly the world's best desktop operating system, but in filesystems it feels like it lags behind.
