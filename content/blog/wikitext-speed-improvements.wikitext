title: Wikitext speed improvements
tags: wikitext

As [/twitter/52 twittered earlier], the already-fast [[Wikitext]] module has seen some pretty spectacular speed improvements lately.

'''Before:'''

 short slab of ASCII text    2.010000   0.020000   2.030000 (  2.133733)
 short slab of UTF-8 text    3.990000   0.040000   4.030000 (  4.174043)
 longer slab of ASCII text  16.700000   0.120000  16.820000 ( 17.302634)
 longer slab of UTF-8 text  50.010000   0.400000  50.410000 ( 54.708712)

'''After:'''

 short slab of ASCII text    1.550000   0.010000   1.560000 (  1.572018)
 short slab of UTF-8 text    2.310000   0.020000   2.330000 (  2.352641)
 longer slab of ASCII text  13.780000   0.100000  13.880000 ( 14.034015)
 longer slab of UTF-8 text  23.150000   0.130000  23.280000 ( 23.505007)

The most spectacular gains were seen for the "longer slab of UTF-8 text" case &mdash; 2 kilobytes of worst-case UTF-8 input like "ñ€w pärägräph wîthîñ blöckquöt€", translated 100,000 times &mdash; which more than doubled in speed.

That's 196.5 megabytes of the worst possible wikitext markup translated in just 23.5 seconds; over 8 megabytes per second on this old iMac, and now almost as fast as the best-case-scenario input (pure ASCII) which clocks in at about 9.6 megabytes per second.
