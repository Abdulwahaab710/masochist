I will be power-cycling the server soon in order to apply a kernel update. Downtime is only expected to be a few minutes. This is the second kernel update so far this month, following [the first](/blog/august-server-maintenance) which took place three weeks ago.

**Update:** The machine is now back up. Downtime was approximately 2 minutes 16 seconds. Notes on the process can be found [here](/wiki/Updating_the_kernel_from_version_2.6.18-128.1.10.el5_to_2.6.18-128.7.1.el5_on_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_5.3).
