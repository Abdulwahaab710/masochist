Upstream network connectivity failure caused applications to flake out one by one, eventually resulting in some kind of resource exhaustion (any attempt to interact with any application which might cause a file access would cause the application to freeze permanently). After waiting nearly 15 minutes decided to proceed with the [hard reset](/wiki/hard_reset). Unfortunately lost a number of different work items in progress.
