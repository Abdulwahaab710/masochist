title: Command-T 1.11.2 released
tags: releases command.t

This is a quick bugfix release that contains only one change, [https://github.com/wincent/command-t/commit/763fcfe84631e0c108db05c428b337ba52200e10 a fix] for [https://github.com/wincent/command-t/issues/109 GitHub issue <nowiki>#</nowiki>109]. For more details, see the original [/blog/command-t-1.11.1-released 1.11.1 release announcement].

This bug warrants a new release because it would break Command-T when used outside of an SCM repo, which for some may be a common use case.
