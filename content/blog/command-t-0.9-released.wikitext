I've just released version 0.9 of the [[Command-T]] plug-in for [[Vim]]. This is a powerful, [[open source]] file-navigation plug-in inspired by the "Command-T" feature in [[TextMate]].

This is a minor maintenance release containing one little enhancement (relative paths are used when opening files under the current working directory, thus keeping buffer listings as concise as possible; patch submitted by Matthew Todd). A full change-log appears under HISTORY in [http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/blob/HEAD:/README.txt the documentation], and all commits in this release are listed [http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/shortlog/refs/tags/0.9 here].

If you're a [[Vim]] user check out the [/products/command-t screencasts] and give the plug-in a try. If you'd like to support development you can use [/products/command-t/donations the donations page] to make a donation, or consider submitting a patch for the project (the source code can be browsed [http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git here]).
