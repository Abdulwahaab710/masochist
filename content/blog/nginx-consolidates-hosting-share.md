title: nginx consolidates hosting share

Just saw last month's [Netcraft](http://netcraft.com/) web server survey and was pleased to see that [nginx](/wiki/nginx) has cemented it's fifth-place spot with a solid 2.4 million hosts in ([survey link](http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2008/08/29/august_2008_web_server_survey.html)). This is of interest to me because nginx is the [HTTP](/wiki/HTTP) server that powers this site (at least, the new [Rails](/wiki/Rails)-backed portions of the site).
