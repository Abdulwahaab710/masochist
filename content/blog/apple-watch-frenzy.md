Pre-orders are opening tomorrow, so I'm seeing a lot of press for the Apple Watch.

Not since the initial Apple TV release have I felt so little desire to own an item from a new Apple product line.

Above all, it's the thought of squinting at and interacting with that tiny screen that drives me crazy. And secondarily, the fact that this is another step towards (mostly unimportant) push notifications being injected directly into our brains...
