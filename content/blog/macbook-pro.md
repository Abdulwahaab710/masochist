title: MacBook Pro
---

I just organized a new MacBook Pro for my colleague with a very attractive developer discount (haven't read the terms and conditions but no doubt I'm forbidden to reveal the actual quantity). These machines, released [back in June](http://www.oreillynet.com/mac/blog/2007/06/macbook_pro_update.html) so still relatively "young", are darn nice.

This elegant little package with its MagSafe connector, LCD-backlit display with gloss finish, illuminated keyboard, tasty processor, integrated iSight camera, remote, dual-layer DVD burner, and 2 GB of RAM standard will be a beautiful little performer.

Personally, if I had the money for a new machine right now I wouldn't be getting a portable; for the same money as my colleague dropped on the MacBook Pro you can get an even nicer iMac, and for me portability isn't something I need at the moment. My lowly little 17", 1.83 GHz iMac is starting to look a bit long in the tooth.
