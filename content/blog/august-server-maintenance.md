I am about to power-cycle the server in order to apply a kernel update. Downtime is only expected to be a few minutes.

**Update:** The machine is now back up. Downtime was approximately 2 minutes 17 seconds. Notes on the process can be found [here](/wiki/Updating_the_kernel_from_version_2.6.18-128.1.6.el5_to_2.6.18-128.4.1.el5_on_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_5.3).
