title: Poor D-Link DSL-2740B performance

Anybody have any experience with the D-Link DSL-2740B ADSL router? Of all the routers I've had over the years, this seems to be among the worst as far as handling BitTorrent traffic is concerned.

With a BT client running (Azureus) configured to connect to no more than 10 peers, the performance of the router just falls through the floor. Ping times climb from about 30ms (for servers in Europe) 150ms (for US servers) to around 3 seconds.

Latest firmware, all unnecessary bells and whistles turned off, and connected via cable rather than wireless. I just can't understand why it handles such modest demands so poorly. And funnily enough, I can't find much commentary on the web about its performance.

Anybody have any experience with this unit?

# Update

I've done quite a bit of experimentation to try and get to the bottom of the performance problem and it seems likely that the router itself is not the problem.

First of all, here's what happens to cross-Atlantic ping times when you fire up a BT client:

    64 bytes from 209.235.214.139: icmp_seq=2927 ttl=44 time=1466.806 ms

Note how it very quickly climbs from a stable 180ms up to 1.5 to 2 seconds. Stop the BT client and within seconds ping times revert to their former levels.

I tried the generic no-brand router that my ISP gave me and it exhibited exactly the same behaviour, so it seems that the connection is getting strangled upstream.

I tried setting Azureus to the minimum number of connections settable in the preferences (2 connections, 2 upload slots) and even with only 1 peer connected was able to reproduce these drastic increases in latency.

It seems to be tied to uploads, not downloads. Keeping the number of upload slots low (2) and heavily limiting the upload speed (to 10K) witness what happens to ping times:

Cranking up the number of connections allowed to over 100 and letting download speeds climb (to 500-600KB/sec) while keeping upload speeds clamped at 10KB/sec yields some degradation but still not the pathological levels being obtained earlier:

So not really sure what's going on upstream, but it seems likely that Telef√≥nica is dropping the ball as soon as you surpass a few kilobytes of upload bandwidth. Not sure if this is intentional (anti-P2P tactic) or just a sign of incompetence.
