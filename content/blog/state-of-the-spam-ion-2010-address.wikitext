The spam "problem" is getting worse. Since [/blog/state-of-the-spam-ion-2009-address my last report] in April 2009 there has been a considerable growth in the volume of spam.

The good news is that the tools used to handle the problem (in particular, [[SpamSieve]]) are more than up to the task, so "quality of life" hasn't really been affected at all.
