Only 10 minutes after the last power cut another one, and again the [UPS](/wiki/UPS) fails to protect the machine. Again the machine won't boot up afterwards until I've unplugged the UPS and turned it off and on again.

Just lost the re-creation of the exact same thing I had been working on when the first failure happened. I think I'm going to turn the machine off and go to bed. It's 3:13 AM and I can't really take much more of this.
