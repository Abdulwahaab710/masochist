Git v1.7.1.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.1
------------------

* Authentication over http transport can now be made lazily, in that the
  request can first go to a URL without username, get a 401 response and
  then the client will ask for the username to use.

* We used to mistakenly think "../work" is a subdirectory of the current
  directory when we are in "../work-xyz".

* The attribute mechanism now allows an entry that uses an attribute
  macro that set/unset one attribute, immediately followed by an
  overriding setting; this makes attribute macros much easier to use.

* We didn't recognize timezone "Z" as a synonym for "UTC" (75b37e70).

* In 1.7.0, read-tree and user commands that use the mechanism such as
  checkout and merge were fixed to handle switching between branches one
  of which has a file while the other has a directory at the same path
  correctly even when there are some "confusing" pathnames in them.  But
  the algorithm used for this fix was suboptimal and had a terrible
  performance degradation especially in larger trees.

* "git am -3" did not show diagnosis when the patch in the message was corrupt.

* After "git apply --whitespace=fix" removed trailing blank lines in an
  patch in a patch series, it failed to apply later patches that depend
  on the presence of such blank lines.

* "git bundle --stdin" segfaulted.

* "git checkout" and "git rebase" overwrote paths that are marked "assume
  unchanged".

* "git commit --amend" on a commit with an invalid author-name line that
  lacks the display name didn't work.

* "git describe" did not tie-break tags that point at the same commit
  correctly; newer ones are preferred by paying attention to the
  tagger date now.

* "git diff" used to tell underlying xdiff machinery to work very hard to
  minimize the output, but this often was spending too many extra cycles
  for very little gain.

* "git diff --color" did not paint extended diff headers per line
  (i.e. the coloring escape sequence didn't end at the end of line),
  which confused "less -R".

* "git fetch" over HTTP verifies the downloaded packfiles more robustly.

* The memory usage by "git index-pack" (run during "git fetch" and "git
  push") got leaner.

* "GIT_DIR=foo.git git init --bare bar.git" created foo.git instead of bar.git.

* "git log --abbrev=$num --format='%h' ignored --abbrev=$num.

* "git ls-files ../out/side/cwd" refused to work.

* "git merge --log" used to replace the custom message given by "-m" with
  the shortlog, instead of appending to it.

* "git notes copy" without any other argument segfaulted.

* "git pull" accepted "--dry-run", gave it to underlying "git fetch" but
  ignored the option itself, resulting in a bogus attempt to merge
  unrelated commit.

* "git rebase" did not faithfully reproduce a malformed author ident, that
  is often seen in a repository converted from foreign SCMs.

* "git reset --hard" started from a wrong directory and a working tree in
  a nonstandard location is in use got confused.

* "git send-email" lacked a way to specify the domainname used in the
  EHLO/HELO exchange, causing rejected connection from picky servers.
  It learned --smtp-domain option to solve this issue.

* "git send-email" did not declare a content-transfer-encoding and
  content-type even when its payload needs to be sent in 8-bit.

* "git show -C -C" and other corner cases lost diff metainfo output
  in 1.7.0.

* "git stash" incorrectly lost paths in the working tree that were
  previously removed from the index.

* "git status" stopped refreshing the index by mistake in 1.7.1.

* "git status" showed excess "hints" even when advice.statusHints is set to false.

And other minor fixes and documentation updates.
