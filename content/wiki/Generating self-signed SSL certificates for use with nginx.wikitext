Here is how I generated a worthless "throwaway" self-signed [[SSL]] certificate for use with [[nginx]] in my staging environment.

 # generate super secret private key
 # (not really, this key and the certificate are "throwaway" items)
 openssl genrsa -des3 -out ssl.key 1024
 
 # generate the self-signed certificate
 openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 365 -key ssl.key -out ssl.crt
 
 # create decrypted version of key so that nginx can be started without a passphrase
 openssl rsa -in ssl.key -out ssl.key.insecure
 chmod 600 ssl.key.insecure
