[SVK](/wiki/SVK) is a pseudo-distributed [version control system](/wiki/version_control_system) with powerful [branching](/wiki/branching) and [merging](/wiki/merging) capabilities and built upon proven [Subversion](/wiki/Subversion) technologies.

SVK is only "psuedo-distributed" rather than "distributed" because it is basically designed to work as a wrapper around an existing centralized workflow. Each developer can create a local mirror of a remote central repository and work on it locally, but these local mirrors are not fully-fledged repositories in their own right (ie. they cannot be published and shared with other developers, except indirectly by pushing changes back to the centralized server). By way of contrast, [Git](/wiki/Git) is an example of a truly distributed version control system in which all repositories are full-fledged, publishable peers.
