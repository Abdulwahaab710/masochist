I keep an [involuntary reboot log](/wiki/involuntary_reboot_log) as a gauge of system reliability. Here are some historical notes.

Most machines seem to average around 20 days between failures.

My best machine was my second MacBook Air, with 42 days between failures.

My worst machine was my first MacBook Air, with 19 days between failures (we discount that loaner laptop because I only had it for a few days).

I try to keep my machines in good shape, refrain from overloading them with dubious crap, and in general treat them very gently. I'm kind of disappointed that the general trend hasn't been towards higher reliability over the years.

# Fourth MacBook Air (Facebook)

I split the data for this machine into two segments, because it had a shell swap partway through its life in order to replace a dummy dislay port (ie. the motherboard including all storage got tranplanted into another case; note that it was still in some sense the same machine, with the same software and OS install).

**Note:** This is the machine I'm currently using, so I'll update this later (and no later than moving on to a new machine).
