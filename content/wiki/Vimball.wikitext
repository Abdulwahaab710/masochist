[[Vimballs]] are files in the "[[vimball]]" format which are intended to make installing and managing [[Vim]] plugins easy.

The format was created by Charles Campbell, and the plugin for working with vimballs is available from [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1502 here]. The plugin is included with all recent versions of [[Vim]].
