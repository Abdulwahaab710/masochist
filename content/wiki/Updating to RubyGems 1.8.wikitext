The RubyGems team has gone on a deprecation frenzy, meaning that after running `sudo gem update --system` every `gem` command is likely to spew a bunch of deprecation warnings across the screen.

To silence those, you'll need to do:

<pre lang="shell">$ sudo gem pristine --all --no-extensions</pre>

Followed by individually for each extension, potentially with optional build arguments after a `--`:

<pre lang="shell">$ sudo gem pristine json</pre>
