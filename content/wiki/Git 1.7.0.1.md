    Git v1.7.0.1 Release Notes
    ==========================

    Fixes since v1.7.0
    ------------------

    * In a freshly created repository "rev-parse HEAD^0" complained that
      it is dangling symref, even though "rev-parse HEAD" didn't.

    * "git show :no-such-name" tried to access the index without bounds
      check, leading to a potential segfault.

    * Message from "git cherry-pick" was harder to read and use than necessary
      when it stopped due to conflicting changes.

    * We referred to ".git/refs/" throughout the documentation when we
      meant to talk about abstract notion of "ref namespace".  Because
      people's repositories often have packed refs these days, this was
      confusing.

    * "git diff --output=/path/that/cannot/be/written" did not correctly
      error out.

    * "git grep -e -pattern-that-begin-with-dash paths..." could not be
      spelled as "git grep -- -pattern-that-begin-with-dash paths..." which
      would be a GNU way to use "--" as "end of options".

    * "git grep" compiled with threading support tried to access an
      uninitialized mutex on boxes with a single CPU.

    * "git stash pop -q --index" failed because the unnecessary --index
      option was propagated to "git stash drop" that is internally run at the
      end.

    And other minor fixes and documentation updates.
