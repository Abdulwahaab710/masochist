GIT v1.6.2.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.2
------------------

* .gitignore learned to handle backslash as a quoting mechanism for
 comment introduction character "#".

* timestamp output in --date=relative mode used to display timestamps that
 are long time ago in the default mode; it now uses "N years M months
 ago", and "N years ago".

* git-add -i/-p now works with non-ASCII pathnames.

* "git hash-object -w" did not read from the configuration file from the
 correct .git directory.

* git-send-email learned to correctly handle multiple Cc: addresses.</pre>
