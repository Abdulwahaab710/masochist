[[Apple]] ships [[ICU]] with [[Mac OS X]] but only as a private library with no headers. You could try building [[ICU]] yourself and embedding it in your application but the library is huge (about 8 megabytes) due to the size of the conversion tables and other data it contains (see http://icu-project.org/userguide/icudata.html#custom_data_library).

Until [[Apple]] decides to make the [[API]] public, one sneaky way of using it indirectly without having to meddle with private libraries is to access it via <tt>NSPredicate</tt>.
