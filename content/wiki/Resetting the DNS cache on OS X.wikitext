Sometimes a process will claim that a host is unknown when trying to connect with one process (eg. `git push`) but others have no trouble doing so (eg. `ping`). The solution may be to bounce the DNS cache.

= The finessed approach =

<pre lang="shell">$ sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist
$ sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist</pre>

Verified to work on [[OS X]] 10.11.2 [[El Capitan]].
