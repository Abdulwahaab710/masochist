* `map()` mutates the collection in place; if you want to avoid this you have to make a copy first.
* `'some string' == 0` evaluates to true (`1`).
* Line-continuation markers (`\`) occur at the beginning of the continuation instead of the end of the continued line, unlike every other language.
* There are no implicit line-continuations (ie. you cannot split a long list over multiple lines after the commas; you have to use explicit line-continuation markers).
* Lists and dictionaries do not permit optional trailing commas after the last item, unlike many other languages.
* Output captured with `redir` will include wrapping (ie. newlines) based on how wide the screen was at runtime.
* `echoerr` [aborts the current function](http://stackoverflow.com/a/30405896/2103996), leading Vim to "not see" any pending `:endif` constructs and complain of `E171: Missing :endif`.
