[Breadth-first search](/wiki/Breadth-first_search) or [BFS](/wiki/BFS) is a "conservative" graph search algorithm in which nodes in a given "layer" are explored before proceeding to explore lower layers.

It is commonly implemented using a [queue](/wiki/queue) data structure, and runs in *O(m + n)* time (where *m* is the number of edges in the graph, and *n* the number of nodes).
