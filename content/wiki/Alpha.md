[Alpha](/wiki/Alpha) is a label applied to software which is in an early stage of testing (often public testing). Unlike [beta](/wiki/beta) software, [alpha](/wiki/alpha) software need not be "feature complete", and it's stability is often significantly less than that of [beta](/wiki/beta) software.
