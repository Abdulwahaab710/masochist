[[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5]] or simply [[RHEL 5]] was released in March 2007, and will be supported by [[Red Hat]] in one way or another until 2014 (see "[[Red Hat Enterprise Linux support policy (EOL dates)]]").

I wasn't able to find an "official" list of installed software packages with [[RHEL 5]] but I did find [http://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/enterprise/5Server/en/os/SRPMS/ this listing] of [[RPMs]], which indicates that the base versions of the following packages are included:

* [[Apache]] 2.2.3
* [[MySQL]] 5.0.22
* [[PHP]] 5.1.6
* [[Ruby]]Â 1.8.5
* [[Python]] 2.4.3
* [[Perl]] 5.8.8
* [[GCC]] 4.1.1
* [[Subversion]] 1.4.2
* [[Mailman]] 2.1.9
* [[Sendmail]] 8.13.8
* [[procmail]] 3.22
* [[Squirrelmail]] 1.4.8
* [[SpamAssassin]] 3.1.7/3.1.8/3.1.9

For reference, compare this with the corresponding [http://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/enterprise/3/en/os/i386/SRPMS/ list] from [[RHEL 3]]:

* [[Apache]] 2.0.46
* [[MySQL]] 3.23.58
* [[PHP]] 4.3.2
* [[Ruby]] 1.6.8
* [[Python]] 2.2.3
* [[Perl]] 5.8.0
* [[GCC]] 3.2.3
* [[Subversion]] not in listing (I thought it was included)
* [[Mailman]] not in listing (I thought it was included)
* [[Sendmail]] 8.12.10
* [[procmail]] 3.22
* [[Squirrelmail]] 1.2.11
* [[SpamAssassin]] 2.55

There is some software which is included in neither [[RHEL 5]] nor [[RHEL 3]] which I consider to be pretty much essential:

* [[ClamAV]]
* [[ClamAssassin]]
* [[Git]]
