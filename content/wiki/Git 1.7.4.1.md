    Git v1.7.4.1 Release Notes
    ==========================

    Fixes since v1.7.4
    ------------------

    * On Windows platform, the codepath to spawn a new child process forgot
      to first flush the output buffer.

    * "git bundle" did not use OFS_DELTA encoding, making its output a few
      per-cent larger than necessarily.

    * The option to tell "git clone" to recurse into the submodules was
      misspelled with an underscore "--recurse_submodules".

    * "git diff --cached HEAD" before the first commit does what an end user
      would expect (namely, show what would be committed without further "git
      add").

    * "git fast-import" didn't accept the command to ask for "notes" feature
      to be present in its input stream, even though it was capable of the
      feature.

    * "git fsck" gave up scanning loose object files in directories with
      garbage files.

    And other minor fixes and documentation updates.
