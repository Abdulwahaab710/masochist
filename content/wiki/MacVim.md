[MacVim](/wiki/MacVim) is a [Cocoa](/wiki/Cocoa) port of [Vim](/wiki/Vim) for [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) maintained by Bj√∂rn Winckler.

The editing experience is much like Vim on any other platform (or like Vim on the [command line](/wiki/command_line) in [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X)), but the Cocoa layer provides attractive windows, some additional integration with the operating system (things like the clipboard), and some other bonus features such as a full-screen mode.
