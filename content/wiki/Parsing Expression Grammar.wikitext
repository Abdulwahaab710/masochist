A [[Parsing Expression Grammar]] is a non-ambiguous grammar useful for describing computer language syntax.

My [[object-oriented templating]] system, [[Walrus]], uses a parser generator that creates parsers from [[Parsing Expression Grammars]]. The generator itself (written in [[Ruby]]) is available in the [[Walrat]] project.
