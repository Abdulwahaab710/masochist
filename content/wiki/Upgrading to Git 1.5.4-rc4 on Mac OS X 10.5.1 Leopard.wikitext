tags: leopard git updates os.x

These notes were made while upgrading to [[Git 1.5.4-rc4]] on [[Mac OS X]] 10.5.1 [[Leopard]], using a local clone of the central [[Git]] repository. I didn't perform the same upgrade on the server.

<pre># get new stuff from upstream
git fetch

# check the signature on the tag
git tag -v v1.5.4-rc4

# switching working tree to v1.5.4-rc4
git checkout v1.5.4-rc4

# clean up any cruft that might be lying around
make clean

# build, run tests, and generate docs
make prefix=/usr/local test doc

# install
sudo make prefix=/usr/local install install-doc</pre>

In order to build the docs you need the documentation toolchain in place; see "[[Setting up the Git documentation build chain on Mac OS X Leopard]]".
