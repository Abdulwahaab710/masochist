In brief:

<pre>raise(SIGBUS);</pre>

<tt>raise</tt> returns -1 on failure and 0 on success, so you should check the return value.

<pre>raise(SIGSEGV);</pre>

I'm not actually sure how to trigger a real [[SIGSEGV]] in a reliable fashion that works in both debug and release builds. For example the following might work in debug builds but fail on release builds:

<pre>char foo[10];
foo[100000] = 'a';</pre>
