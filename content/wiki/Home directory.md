The [home directory](/wiki/home_directory) or "[home dir](/wiki/home_dir)" is a per-user directory set aside for access and use by that specific user. Generally some sort of filesystem permissions are used to ensure that users don't have undue access to other users' [home directories](/wiki/home_directories).
