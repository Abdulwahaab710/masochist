The structure of the [[main Git repository]] for [[Git]] itself is explained here:

* http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/39954

= Branches not related to the source tree of [[Git]] =

== <tt>todo</tt> ==

* A [[TODO]] list, "not as often updated as it could/should be"
* Helper scripts used to maintain [[Git]]

== <tt>html</tt> ==

* Autogenerated documentation from the tip of the "master" branch, extracted to be visible at: http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/

== <tt>man</tt> ==

* Autogenerated documentation from the tip of the "master" branch

= Branches that track the [[Git]] source tree =

== <tt>master</tt> ==

* "Reasonably tested and ready to be used in a production setting"
* Occasional "feature releases" (eg. 1.5.0) cut from tip of this branch
* Trival, safe enhancements committed here
* Never rewound, "so you should be able to safely track"

== <tt>maint</tt> ==

* Forked off from <tt>master</tt> when a feature release is made
* "Obvious, safe and urgent fixes" applied to this branch
* Maintenance releases cut from this branch (eg. 1.5.0.1)
* Merged into "master" to propagate the fixes forward
* Never rewound, "so you should be able to safely track"

== <tt>next</tt> ==

* New features developed in topic branches forked off <tt>master</tt> and then merged here when "more or less done and can now be tested by wider audience"
* "might not be quite production ready, but are expected to work more or less without major breakage"
* "where new and exciting things take place"
* reset to the tip of the "master" branch after each major feature release (formely was: Never rewound, "so you should be able to safely track"; "topics that have been merged into 'next' are not rebased")
* Topics here expected to be "tweaked and fixed to perfection" before being merged into <tt>master</tt>

== <tt>pu</tt> ==

* "Proposed updates" branch
* For all other topic branches
* Subject to rebasing in general
* When topics in <tt>pu</tt> reach "testable shape" they graduate to <tt>next</tt>
* Topics that turn out not to be promising may be dropped from <tt>pu</tt>
