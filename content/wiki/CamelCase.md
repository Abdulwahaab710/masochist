[CamelCase](/wiki/CamelCase) is the convention for forming compound words (words made up of other words) by capitalizing the first letter of each component word and joining them together without any intervening space.

It is a frequently used convention for class names in [Objective-C](/wiki/Objective-C) and [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby):

-   `NSString`
-   `SmallHash`

And in the case of [Objective-C](/wiki/Objective-C) a variant in which the first letter is made lower case is often employed for variable names:

-   `myVariable`
-   `lowerBound`
