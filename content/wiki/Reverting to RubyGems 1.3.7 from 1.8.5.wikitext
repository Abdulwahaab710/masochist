In order to silence a raft of deprecation warnings in an environment where there are a lot of old gems and in which I can't update them:

<pre lang="shell">$ sudo gem update --system 1.3.7</pre>

'''Note:''' this approach seems to work fine for [[Ruby]] 1.8.7, but [http://help.rubygems.org/discussions/problems/617-downgrading-rubygems-from-185-to-137-gives-an-error may not work for later versions of Ruby].
