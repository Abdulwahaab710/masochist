= Updating [[PCRE]] =

We won't update [[PCRE]] here because we don't want to lose the automatic updates of the [[Red Hat]]-supplied version.

= Updating [[nginx]] and using the [[nginx upload module]] =

The [[nginx upload module]] was already in extracted in place (see "[[Installing nginx 0.7.62 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3]]") so we just download the updated [[nginx]] source and extract that alongside it:

<pre lang="shell">$ wget http://sysoev.ru/nginx/nginx-0.7.64.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf nginx-0.7.64.tar.gz 
$ cd nginx-0.7.64
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/nginx --with-http_ssl_module --add-module=../nginx_upload_module-2.0.10
$ make</pre>

Now we gracefully update the binary in place without dropping any existing connections (see "[[Updating to a new nginx binary on the fly]]" for more details).

The first step is to get the [[PID]] of the old [[nginx]] master process &mdash; in this example it is 31662 &mdash; and then perform the update in place by sending the appropriate signals to that process:

<pre lang="shell">$ ps auxww|grep nginx
$ sudo make install
$ sudo kill -s USR2 31662
$ sudo kill -s WINCH 31662
$ sudo kill -s QUIT 31662</pre>
