[[Functional programming]] is an approach to programming in which programs are composed of functions that are evaluated rather than executed in sequence. These are not functions in the [[C]] sense but mathematical functions of the style <tt>f(x) = y + 2</tt>; that is, for a given input or set of inputs the function describes the result.

This is starkly different to [[imperative programming]] in which programs at the source code level mirror the sequential execution at the hardware level. Functional programming operates at a higher level of abstraction because it has no notion of sequence of operations and in fact operations don't have any side effects.
