= Installation =

<pre lang="shell">$ brew cask install xquartz
$ open /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/xquartz/2.7.7/XQuartz.pkg
$ brew install ffmpeg imagemagick gifsicle
$ sudo gem install screengif</pre>

= Use =

After recording a movie with, say, QuickTime Player:

<pre lang="shell">$ screengif -i Untitled.mov -o bug-repord.gif</pre>

= OS upgrades =

I found when upgrading to [[OS X]] [[El Capitan]] that I had to reinstall, because screengif was somewho trying to use an old version of ImageMagick. So I just uninstalled and reinstalled everything:

<pre lang="shell">$ brew cask uninstall xquartz
$ brew uninstall --force ffmpeg imagemagick gifsicle
$ sudo gem uninstall screengif rmagick</pre>
