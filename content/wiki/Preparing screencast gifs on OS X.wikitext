= Installation =

<pre lang="shell">$ brew cask install xquartz
$ open /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/xquartz/2.7.7/XQuartz.pkg
$ brew install ffmpeg imagemagick gifsicle
$ sudo gem install screengif</pre>

= Use =

After recording a movie with, say, QuickTime Player:

<pre lang="shell">$ screengif -i Untitled.mov -o bug-repord.gif</pre>

= OS upgrades =

I found when upgrading to [[OS X]] [[El Capitan]] that I had to reinstall, because screengif was somewho trying to use an old version of ImageMagick. So I just uninstalled and reinstalled everything:

<pre lang="shell">$ brew cask uninstall xquartz
$ brew uninstall --force ffmpeg imagemagick gifsicle
$ sudo gem uninstall screengif rmagick</pre>

On upgrading to Sierra I found that things had changed again, and the answer lied in [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39494672/rmagick-installation-cant-find-magickwand-h this Stack Overflow post]:

<pre lang="shell">$ sudo gem uninstall rmagick screengif
$ brew uninstall --force ffmpeg imagemagick gifsicle
$ brew install ffmpeg imagemagick gifsicle
$ brew install imagemagick@6
$ brew unlink imagemagick
$ brew link --force imagemagick@6
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/imagemagick@6/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
$ sudo gem install screengif</pre>

In short, a world of pain, and some voodoo coding until I found what worked.
