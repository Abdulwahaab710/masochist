"[Radar](/wiki/Radar)" is the nickname for the internal bug-tracking system used by [Apple](/wiki/Apple). Anyone with an [ADC](/wiki/ADC) account can file bug reports at <http://bugreporter.apple.com/>, but the tracker is private, meaning that you can only see issues which you yourself have opened but not those opened by other people.
