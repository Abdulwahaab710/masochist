= Testing [[SMTP]] =

For added security, I use authenticated [[SMTP]] for sending mail, using the <tt>LOGIN</tt> mechanism. This requires that first I had to [[Base64]] encode my username and password:

<pre>perl -MMIME::Base64 -e 'print encode_base64("username");'
perl -MMIME::Base64 -e 'print encode_base64("password");'</pre>

For example, to test [[SMTP]] you could use something like:

<pre>telnet mail.example.com 25
EHLO 127.0.0.1
AUTH LOGIN
(Base-64 encoded username)
(Base-64 encoded password)
MAIL FROM: <user1@example.com>
RCPT TO: <user2@example.com>
DATA
FROM: <user1@example.com>
Mail test, please ignore.
.
QUIT</pre>

As [http://www.sendmail.org/~ca/email/starttls.html documented here], to test [[secure SMTP]] you would need to use [[openssl]] instead of [[telnet]]:

<pre>openssl s_client -starttls smtp -connect host:port</pre>

Where <tt>port</tt> is most likely <tt>25</tt>. In the case of [[SMTP over SSL]] (not using <tt>STARTTLS</tt>) you would use:

<pre>openssl s_client -connect host:port</pre>

In this latter case <tt>port</tt> is most likely to be <tt>465</tt>.

But note that, [http://www.forbiddenweb.org/topic/78761/index.html as commented here], any line beginning with <tt>R</tt> will trigger a renegotiation of the [[SSL/TLS]] session so you must enter:

<pre> RCPT TO:</pre>

And not:

<pre>RCPT TO:</pre>

You can also suppress this behavior by passing in the `-ign_eof` switch.

== Alternative host and port syntax ==

It is possible to pass in the host and port options explicitly:

<pre lang="shell">$ openssl s_client -host smtp.gmail.com -port 587 -starttls smtp</pre>

= Testing [[IMAP]] =

[http://bobpeers.com/technical/telnet_imap.php This page] offers a nice overview.

= See also =

* [http://www.unixreview.com/documents/s=9700/ur0504l/ur0504l.html This page] has lots of examples on how you can use [[telnet]] to manually test various services [February 2010, the link is now dead].
