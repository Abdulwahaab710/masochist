I was wondering what Junio uses to produces the [http://repo.or.cz/w/git.git?a=blob;f=Documentation/RelNotes-1.5.3.4.txt release notes for Git]. Looking at the AsciiDoc source reveals the following:

<pre>exec >/var/tmp/1
O=v1.5.3.3-6-g0bdcac5
echo O=`git describe refs/heads/maint`
git shortlog --no-merges $O..refs/heads/maint</pre>

So it turns out there is a nifty tool called <tt>git-shortlog</tt> which does just the right thing if you format your commit messages following the recommended conventions (one line summary followed by a blank line and then an extended description).

It can be used to print out some nice summary information about the number of commits per author:

<pre>git log --pretty=short | git shortlog -s</pre>
