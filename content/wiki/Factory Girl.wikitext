[[Factory Girl]] is an "[[object mother]]" framework written in [[Ruby]]. It plays nicely with [[RSpec]] and [[Rails]].

I've been a Factory Girl user since mid-2010, after a long period using [[FixtureReplacement]]. I switched principally because it doesn't pollute the global namespace with `create_model` methods, and it handles edge cases and associations very elegantly and powerfully.
