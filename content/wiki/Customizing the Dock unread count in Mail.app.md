Just found this sweet little tip [here](http://kuwayama.com/tip-set-the-unread-count-notice-in-mailapp).

[Mail.app](/wiki/Mail.app) has preferences which allow you to select what mailbox(es) will be used as a source for the unread messages count shown in the Dock icon badge.

-   **None**
-   **Inbox Only**
-   **All Mailboxes**
-   or, critically, **Any "Smart Mailbox" of your choosing**

This means that you can set up a smart mailbox to mirror the contents of any mailbox (or mailboxes) that you care about, and have that show up in the Dock icon.

I use this at work so I can have new messages arriving in my work account immediately brought to my attention, while messages sent to my personal accounts won't distract me. Prior to learning this tip, I used to actually take my personal accounts offline whenever I got to work, and take them back online before going home.
