This is a list of useful editing commands available in the [[Bash]] shell on [[Mac OS X]]. Unfortunately many other editing commands are omitted because they use the "meta" key (Command on the Mac), which is intercepted by the [[Terminal]] application and never actually sent to the underlying shell. Unfortuantely the Opt key can't be used as a substitute, because it is already used to assist typing non-ASCII characters.

= Movement =

* `<C-a>`: move to start of line
* `<C-e>`: move to end of line

= Cutting and pasting =

* `<C-k>`: kill (cut) from cursor to end of line
* `<C-w>`: kill (cut) from cursor to previous whitespace
* `<C-y>`: yank (paste) previously killed text at cursor

= Other =

* `<C-l>`: clear screen, reprinting current line at top
* `<C-u>`: undo last edit

= Redundant commands =

* `<C-b>`: move back one character (equivalent to left cursor)
* `<C-f>`: move forward one character (equivalent to right cursor)
* `<C-d>`: delete character under cursor (equivalent to delete)
