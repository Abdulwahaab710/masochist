[[Depth-first search]] (or [[DFS]]) is an aggressive search of a graph where each exploration continues as far as possible, only backtracking when absolutely necessary.

It is commonly implemented using recursion, but can also be implemented in terms of a [[stack]] (ie. where freshly expanded nodes are pushed onto a stack).

Exploring a [[directed acyclic graph]] using [[depth-first search]] gives a [[topological ordering]] (ie. every edge has a starting point earlier in the ordering than the ending point of the edge); this is useful for computing dependencies.
