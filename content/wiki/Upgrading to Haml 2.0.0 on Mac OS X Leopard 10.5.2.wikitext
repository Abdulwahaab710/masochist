Updating the [[gem]] itself is easy:

 sudo gem install haml --no-ri

This is how I updated an existing [[Rails]] application which had an existing copy of an older version of [[Haml]] "frozen" into the `vendor/plugins` directory:

<pre># blow away old gem
git rm -r vendor/plugins/haml

# clone the official repo (seeing as we can't just "svn export" anymore)
git clone git://github.com/nex3/haml.git vendor/plugins/haml

# make sure we have the right commit checked out
(cd vendor/plugins/haml && git co 2.0.0)

# blow away unwanted metadata
rm -rf vendor/plugins/haml/.git

# take a snapshot
git add vendor/plugins/haml</pre>

For info on setting up aliases like `git co` see "[[Git quickstart]]".
