== Named routing helpers ==

Allow the use of named routing helpers like `user_path()` in the console:

<pre lang="ruby">include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers</pre>

You can also use the `app` object available on the console:

<pre lang="ruby">app.articles_path</pre>

= Rails 2 =

== Named routes ==

This information can be found in a few places; this time I copied it from [http://stuartsierra.com/2008/01/08/testing-named-routes-in-the-rails-console here]:

 include ActionController::UrlWriter
 default_url_options[:host] = 'whatever'

After this you can use named route helper methods like `root_path` and the like.

== Generation ==

 rs = ActionController::Routing::Routes
 generate :controller => 'foo', :action => 'bar'

== Recognition ==

 rs.recognize_path '/'
