Without appropriate configuration you may find that your [[Apache]] [[webserver]] delivers [[dmg]] files to users as text in their browser windows rather than downloading them as binary files.

To avoid this you need to add `dmg` to the appropriate line in your `mime.types` file.

For example, in my [[RHEL 5.1]] server I needed a line like the following in `/etc/mime.types`:

 application/octet-stream	bin dms lha lzh exe class so dll img iso dmg

`application/octet-stream` is the right type, as confirmed by inspecting the corresponding settings provided by [[Apple]] in [[Mac OS X]] (in `/private/etc/apache2/mime.types`):

 application/octet-stream bin dms lha lzh class so iso dmg dist distz pkg bpk dump elc scpt

For good measure, after making the change I did a `sudo apachectl graceful` to ensure that [[Apache]] picked up the changes.
