Found in a comment on [http://frozenplague.net/2008/12/showing-sql-statements-in-scriptconsole/ this weblog post]; stick this in your `~/.irbrc`:

<pre>if ENV['RAILS_ENV']
  # Called after the irb session is initialized and Rails has been loaded
  IRB.conf[:IRB_RC] = Proc.new do
    logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
    ActiveRecord::Base.logger = logger
    ActiveResource::Base.logger = logger
  end
end</pre>

Now when you interact with the database you'll see it interspersed, colorized with the other output:

<pre>$ script/console
Loading development environment (Rails 2.2.2)
>> Issue.first
  Issue Load (0.7ms)   SELECT * FROM `issues` LIMIT 1
=> #<Issue id: 1, created_at: "2009-01-17 21:26:42", updated_at: "2009-01-18 00:00:57"></pre>
