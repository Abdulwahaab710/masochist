Last night the [[WordPress]] folks announced a rushed new release to address what is apparently a pretty major flaw in [[PHP]]'s [[Zend Engine]]. I unfortunately didn't have a lot of time to do a thorough upgrade (with backups etc) but I felt that quickly patching was important given that I didn't have time to find out whether Red Hat had already pushed out a fix for the PHP flaw (there doesn't seem to be a [[CVE]] number for this issue yet, not does it appear in the [[Red Hat "Days of Risk Report"]] yet); so I decided to bite the bullet and do the famous "Five second upgrade":

<pre>cd path_to_wp_install
svn info
svn -u apache_user -H svn switch http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.0.7</pre>

Output:

<pre>U    wp-includes/version.php
U    wp-includes/classes.php
U    wp-includes/functions.php
U    wp-settings.php
U    wp-admin/inline-uploading.php
U    wp-admin/post.php
Updated to revision 4734.</pre>

Then:

<pre>svn -u apache_user -H svn up</pre>

Output:

<pre>Fetching external item into 'wp-content/plugins/akismet'
U    wp-content/plugins/akismet/akismet.php
Updated external to revision 7358.</pre>

Then hit <tt>wp-admin/upgrade.php</tt> using your web browser.

See the last upgrade notes for a more detailed procedure ("[[Upgrading from WordPress 2.0.5 to 2.0.6 using Subversion]]").
