[Terminal.app](/wiki/Terminal.app) is the official [Terminal](/wiki/Terminal) application shipped by [Apple](/wiki/Apple) with [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X).

It was fairly primitive in early versions of Mac OS X, but a number of improvements have been added over the years which have made it into quite a nice [command line](/wiki/command_line) interface.

The most viable alternative on Mac OS X is [iTerm 2](/wiki/iTerm_2).
