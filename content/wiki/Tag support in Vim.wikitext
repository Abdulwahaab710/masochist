= Creating a tags file =

Make sure [[Exuberant Ctags]] is installed (eg. `sudo yum install ctags` or similar, depending on your [[OS]]).

To actually create a tags file, for [[Rails]] projects, run:

 :Rtags

(requires [[Tim Pope's]] [[rails.vim]] plug-in).

= Jumping to a definition =

Either in command mode:

 :tag foo

Or by hitting `Ctrl-]` over a keyword.

For cycling through matches we have:

* `:tn` (next)
* `:tp` (previous)
* `:tf` (first)
* `:tl` (last)
* `:ts` (select from list)

For jumping back, `Ctrl-T` (or use `Ctrl-I`/`Ctrl-O` to move through the `:jump` list).

= Show all tags =

 :tags
