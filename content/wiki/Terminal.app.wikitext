[[Terminal.app]] is the official [[Terminal]] application shipped by [[Apple]] with [[Mac OS X]].

It was fairly primitive in early versions of Mac OS X, but a number of improvements have been added over the years which have made it into quite a nice [[command line]] interface.

The most viable alternative on Mac OS X is [[iTerm 2]].
