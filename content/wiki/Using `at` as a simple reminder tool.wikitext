<pre lang="shell">$ at 8:58pm
dialog -message 'foo'
job 3 at Sun Jul 28 20:58:00 2013</pre>

(Use `<Control-D>` to finish entering the job.)

Alternatively, if you don't have `dialog` command (and you probably don't because I haven't made it easy to get; see [/issues/1502 this feature request]), you can use the built-in `osascript`:

  osascript -e 'tell app "System Events" to display dialog "foo"'

'''Note:''' In order for any of this to work, you need to enable `at` jobs to run; see `man atrun`:

<pre lang="shell">$ sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.atrun.plist</pre>

= Other handy commands =

* `atq`: see what is in the `at` queue
* `atrm`: remove jobs from the `at` queue
