[[Object-oriented templating]] is a [[object-oriented]] templating approach inspired by [[object-oriented programming]]. 

Templates are actually compiled down to classes in an inheritance hierarchy, which means that templates lower down in the hierarchy can specialize, override, or augment regions of their parent templates. This approach allows for a fine degree of control over per-template customization while keeping repetition to a minimum.

Executing the compiled templates, otherwise known as "filling" them, produces the final output.

= Examples of object-oriented templating systems =

* [[Cheetah]] is an [[object-oriented templating]] engine written in [[Python]]
* [[Walrus]] is my own [[object-oriented templating]] system written in [[Ruby]]
