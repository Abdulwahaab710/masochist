For some reason, [Apple](/wiki/Apple) makes it ridiculously hard to discover the download for these tools, but it turns out that you can install them easily with:

```shell
$ xcode-select --install
```

**Note:** You may have to install [Xcode](/wiki/Xcode) from the Mac App Store first, in order to get the `xcode-select` binary. (I don't know for sure, because I had already installed Xcode before trying to get the Command Line Tools.)
