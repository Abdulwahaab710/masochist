Considered by many to be the best operating system in the world (and by me to be the best *desktop* operating system in the world), [OS X](/wiki/OS_X) is [Apple](/wiki/Apple)'s current flagship operating system.

See: <http://www.apple.com/osx/>

For a long time the official name of the [OS](/wiki/OS) was "Mac OS X" (pronounced "Mac OS Ten"). There were few who actually referred to it this way. Common usage was often "OS X" (either pronounced as-is or as "OS Ten").

With the release of [Mountain Lion](/wiki/Mountain_Lion) [Apple](/wiki/Apple) finally started referring to it as "OS X" in marketing materials and the "About this Mac" dialog.
