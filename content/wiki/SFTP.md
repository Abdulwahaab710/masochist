[SFTP](/wiki/SFTP), the [SSH file transfer protocol](/wiki/SSH_file_transfer_protocol), is a secure transport mechanism that has largely replaced [FTP](/wiki/FTP) for the purposes of authenticated transfer and file manipulation ([FTP](/wiki/FTP) continues to be popular for anonymous, unauthenticated, unencrypted transfers).
