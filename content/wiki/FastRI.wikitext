[[FastRI]] is a faster replacement for [[ri]] which produces colorized output. It can be installed as follows:

<pre>sudo gem install fastri</pre>

The index can then be generated (or updated) using:

<pre>fastri-server -b</pre>

Local queries can then be run using commands like this:

<pre>qri String#chomp!</pre>

Instead of the standard:

<pre>ri String#chomp!</pre>

Note that in order to search the built-in classes you must explicitly install the documentation for them as described in "[[Getting ri working for built-in classes]]".
