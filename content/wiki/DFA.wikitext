A [[DFA]], also known as a [[Deterministic Finite Automata]] or "[[deterministic finite state machine]]" is a [[finite state machine]] capable of recognizing [[regular languages]] (languages recognizable using regular expressions). It can recognize repeated but not recursive structures.

[[DFAs]] are called "deterministic" because for each state and input symbol there is one and only one transition to the next state.

= Software that uses [[DFAs]] =

* [[ANTLR]] constructs [[DFAs]] for the purposes of predicting alternatives.
* [[Ragel]] is a state machine compiler.
