There is some documentation on the official site but the best documentation by far is ''The Definitive ANTLR Reference'' by [[Terence Parr]], the author of [[ANTLR]]:

* http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/tpantlr/index.html

[[ANTLR]] itself is free software released under the [[BSD license]] so purchasing the book is a great way to support Terence's efforts. I purchased the "beta" version of the book in [[PDF]] ($25), which includes access to the final version of the book when it is published (in May 2007). The quality of the [[Pragmatic]] [[PDFs]] is very high.

You can also support by posting a review of the book at [[Amazon]], as your review may encourage others to make a purchase:
