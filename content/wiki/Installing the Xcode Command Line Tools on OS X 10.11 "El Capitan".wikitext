For some reason, [[Apple]] makes it ridiculously hard to discover the download for these tools, but it turns out that you can install them easily with:

<pre lang="shell">$ xcode-select --install</pre>

'''Note:''' You may have to install [[Xcode]] from the Mac App Store first, in order to get the `xcode-select` binary. (I don't know for sure, because I had already installed Xcode before trying to get the Command Line Tools.)
