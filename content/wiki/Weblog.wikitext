A [[weblog]] is a reverse chronological order log-like online journal published to the web.

Popular software for writing [[weblogs]] includes [[Movable Type]] and [[WordPress]], but there are many, many others.

In the past I maintained a personal weblog at http://colaiuta.net/ and a product news weblog at http://wincent.org/, both powered by [[Movable Type]], but these have been replaced by the new weblog which you can access by clicking the "Blog" link in the navigation bar at the top of every page on the site.
