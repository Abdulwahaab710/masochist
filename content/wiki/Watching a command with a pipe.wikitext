Ideally you'd express the command as a single invocation with options to do what you want, but if you must use a pipe, enclose the whole thing in quotes; eg:

<pre lang="shell">$ watch "ps auxwww|grep ec2-user"</pre>

This is considerably easier than my first attempt at this:

<pre lang="shell">$ watch 'bash -c "ps auxwww|grep ec2-user"'</pre>

Of course, in this case, there ''is'' an option you can pass that allows you to do this without a pipe, so that's the optimal case:

<pre lang="shell">$ watch ps -U ec2-user uxwww</pre>
