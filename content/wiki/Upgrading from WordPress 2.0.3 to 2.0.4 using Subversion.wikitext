See: [[Preparing WordPress for Subversion-based upgrades]]

= For the reckless: the 5 second upgrade =

The reckless can perform the upgrade with a single command from inside their [[WordPress]] install. The use of [[sudo]] and the <tt>-u user -H</tt> options (where you would substitute an appropriate value for <tt>user</tt>) is to ensure that ownership of the files does not change during the update (necessary if you are running in [[PHP Safe Mode]]):

<pre>sudo -u user -H svn switch http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.0.4</pre>

A less reckless upgrade procedure is described below, which includes making a backup before upgrading.

= For the careful: the 5 minute upgrade =

== Check the trunk, branches and tags directories in the repository ==

Given that in recent versions the [[WordPress]] team hasn't always maintained an [http://wincent.com/a/knowledge-base/archives/2006/06/wordpress_updat.php up-to-date set of tags] in their [[Subversion]] repository, it is a good idea to check that recent changes in the <tt>trunk</tt>, <tt>branches</tt> and <tt>tags</tt> directories on the repository all match up. At the time of [http://wordpress.org/development/2006/07/wordpress-204/ the 2.0.4 release announcement] all three directories appeared to be in sync:

* http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.0.4/
* http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/2.0/
* http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/trunk/

I checked using the following commands:

<pre>svn log --limit 5 http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.0.4
svn log --limit 5 http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/branches/2.0
svn log --limit 5 http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/trunk</pre>

And incidentally, using the <tt>svn log</tt> command (with a higher <tt>--limit</tt> value) is one way of seeing what changes have been made to the source tree. This is useful seeing as the [[WordPress]] team likes to practise a little bit of [[security through obscurity]], labelling a release as a containing "several important security fixes" but neglecting to mention what they are, nor any of the other "bug fixes (over 50!)" in the release. You can also [http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=2.0.4 check the WordPress trac].

== Backup the database ==

Choosing appropriate values for <tt>${MYSQLUSER}</tt>, <tt>${DATABASE}</tt> and <tt>${FILENAME}</tt>:

<pre>/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/mysqldump --opt -u "${MYSQLUSER}" -p -h localhost \
      "${DATABASE}" | /usr/bin/bzip2 -c > "~/${FILENAME}"</pre>

== Backup the installed files ==

If your [[WordPress]] install was in the folder <tt>wp</tt> you would <tt>cd</tt> into its parent folder and do something like this:

<pre>/usr/bin/sudo /bin/tar -c -v wp > ~/pre-2.0.4-backup.tar
/bin/gzip --verbose -9 ~/pre-2.0.4-backup.tar</pre>

== Disable all plug-ins ==

http://example.com/wp-admin/plugins.php

== Perform the upgrade ==

Get info on the working copy:

<pre>svn info</pre>

Perform the actual upgrade, substituting an appropriate value for <tt>${USER}</tt>:

<pre>sudo -u "${USER}" -H svn switch http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.0.4</pre>

Finally, compare the info on the updated working copy:

<pre>svn info</pre>

It seems that in this release it is not necessary to hit the upgrade script:

http://example.com/wordpress/wp-admin/upgrade.php

== Re-enable all plug-ins ==
