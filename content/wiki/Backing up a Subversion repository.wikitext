= Options =

There are two main ways of backing up a live [[Subversion]] repository:

# Using <tt>svnadmin hotcopy</tt>
#Â Using <tt>svnadmin dump</tt>

In both cases you should run <tt>svnadmin</tt> as the owner of the repository. I chose to go with the second option for two reasons:

# I can pipe the dumpfile through <tt>bzip2</tt> to compress it on the fly
# I can use the dumpfile with future versions of [[Subversion]]

= Disk usage =

* Repository size on disk: 65[[MB]]
* Backup size on disk: 78[[MB]] (note that this is actual two backups, "today's" and "yesterday's", because the backup script keeps a copy of the previous dump file; so the actual size per backup is really about 39[[MB]]).
