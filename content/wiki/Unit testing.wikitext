[[Unit testing]] is typically used as either:

# A general term used to describe any automated-testing procedure that performs tests on a piece of software and checks to make sure that the obtained results meet the expectations defined by the programmer.
# More specifically, [[unit testing]] may refer to a specific kind of test, the [[unit test]], which is a low-level test that checks the operation of a piece of code at the lowest possible level external to the code itself. In the case of [[object-oriented programming]] the lowest level of externally visible, testable functionality is usually a single method; so in this case "[[unit tests]]" usually refers to test which check the operation of an individual method.

Other related terms include [[functional tests]] and [[acceptance tests]].

I've written my own framework for [[unit testing]] [[Objective-C]] code, [[WOTest]].

[[Unit testing]] is an integral part of the [[continuous integration]] development process.
