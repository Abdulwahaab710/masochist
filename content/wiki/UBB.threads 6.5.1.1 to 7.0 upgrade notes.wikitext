= Backup =

* Log in to control panel and close board
* Copy text from control panel, "Display Options", "General", "HTML Includes"
* Perform backup of database:

<pre>mysqldump --opt -u USERNAME -p -h localhost DATABASE_NAME | \
  bzip2 -c > BACKUP_FILE.sql.bz2</pre>

= Installation =

* Create a new database for the new forums:

<pre>mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE new_db_name;
GRANT ALL ON new_db_name.* TO 'new_user_name'@'localhost';
SET PASSWORD FOR 'new_user_name'@'localhost' = OLD_PASSWORD('new_password');
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</pre>

(The <tt>OLD_PASSWORD</tt> trick is necessary because [[UBB.threads]] will be connecting to the database using PHP, and the version of PHP on the server is compiled against a pre-4.1 version of the MySQL libraries; see [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/password-hashing.html this page on password hashing] for more information.)

* Create new forums directory:

<pre>sudo -u WEB_USER mkdir new-forums
sudo -u WEB_USER /bin/echo "Forums currently unavailable while upgrade is in progress" > \
  new-forums/index.html</pre>

* Move old forums out-of-the-way:

<pre>sudo -u WEB_USER mv forums old-forums
sudo -u WEB_USER mv new-forums forums</pre>

* Install the new forums according to the instructions into <tt>new-forums</tt>:

<pre>sudo -u WEB_USER mkdir new-forums</pre>

* Upload the files into, then set permissions and move new forums into place:

<pre>cd new-forums
sudo chmod 777 includes
sudo chmod 666 includes/*
sudo chmod 777 sessions
sudo chmod 777 templates/compile
sudo chmod 777 templates
sudo chmod 777 cache
sudo chmod 777 cache_builders
sudo chmod 777 cache_builders/custom
sudo chmod 666 cache_builders/custom/*
sudo chmod 777 styles
sudo chmod 666 styles/*.php styles/*.css
cd ..
sudo rm -r forums
sudo mv new-forums forums</pre>

* Run the upgrade script at: http://example.com/path_to_forums/install/install.php
* Use a custom cookie prefix to prevent cookies from other apps (such as [[Bugzilla]]) from interfering with the forums.
* As this is an upgrade installation, do not create an admin user; instead proceed directly to the "Creating your tables" step.

= Import =

* Upload importer script
* Execute in browser

<pre>Importing Banned Host: NULL
Script: 
Line#: 
SQL Error: 
SQL Error #: 0
Query: insert into ubbt_BANNED_HOSTS values ( NULL )</pre>

On investigation:

<pre>mysql> USE old_database_name;
mysql> SELECT * FROM w3t_Banned;
+------------+
| B_Hostname |
+------------+
| NULL       |
+------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> delete from w3t_Banned;</pre>

Inspection of the <tt>threads_import.php</tt> script indicated that it would probably be safe to go back and pick up import from where it left off by visiting: http://example.com/path_to_forums/importers/threads_import.php?ubb=extras

Only glitch at end is that I saw some [[PHP]] warnings with regard to my <tt>open_basedir</tt> restriction; may have to disable that for the forums directory.

= Cleanup =

Due to permissions errors I'm temporarily turning off [[PHP]]Â [[Safe Mode]] within the forums directory and changing the ownership on all files:

<pre>cd path_to_forums
sudo chown -R apache_user:apache_group *</pre>

* Drop old database

<pre>USE mysql;
DROP DATABASE old_database_name;
DELETE FROM user WHERE User = 'old_username';
DELETE FROM db WHERE Db = 'old_database_name';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</pre>

* Remove old forum files
* Upload redirection scripts so that old links will continue to work
* Delete <tt>importers</tt> and <tt>install</tt> subdirectories
