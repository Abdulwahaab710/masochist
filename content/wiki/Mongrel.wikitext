[[Mongrel]] is a web application server for [[Ruby]] applications. Although it was very popular in the early days of [[Rails]] hosting it effectively stagnated and was dropped by the original maintainer; it has since been somewhat eclipsed by alternatives like [[Unicorn]] (itself a derivative of Mongrel) and Passenger.

I personally used Mongrel to host this site from its initial deployment (in March 2008) up until I moved to the [[cloud]] and switched to [[Unicorn]] (in February 2010).
