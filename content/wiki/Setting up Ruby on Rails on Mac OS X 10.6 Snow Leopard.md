**Note:** These build notes were made while working with a first-generation Intel-powered iMac, and as such are specific to a 32-bit architecture. For notes made building on a 64-bit platform see "[Setting up Ruby on Rails on Max OS X 10.6.2 Snow Leopard](/wiki/Setting_up_Ruby_on_Rails_on_Max_OS_X_10.6.2_Snow_Leopard)".

# Other requirements

My workflow requires [nginx](/wiki/nginx), [memcached](/wiki/memcached) and [MySQL](/wiki/MySQL). In addition to installing these on my local [Snow Leopard](/wiki/Snow_Leopard) machine I took the opportunity to update a couple of components on the server ([nginx](/wiki/nginx) and [memcached](/wiki/memcached)) so as to have exactly the same versions on both my deployment and development machines.

## [nginx](/wiki/nginx)

See:

-   [Installing nginx 0.7.61 on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard](/wiki/Installing_nginx_0.7.61_on_Mac_OS_X_10.6_Snow_Leopard)
-   [Updating to nginx 0.7.61 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3](/wiki/Updating_to_nginx_0.7.61_on_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_5.3)

## [memcached](/wiki/memcached)

See:

-   [Installing memcached 1.4.1 on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard](/wiki/Installing_memcached_1.4.1_on_Mac_OS_X_10.6_Snow_Leopard)
-   [Updating to memcached 1.4.1 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3](/wiki/Updating_to_memcached_1.4.1_on_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_5.3)

## [MySQL](/wiki/MySQL)

See:

-   [Installing MySQL 5.0.85 on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard](/wiki/Installing_MySQL_5.0.85_on_Mac_OS_X_10.6_Snow_Leopard)

Note that this is not an exact match with the version running on the server (5.0.45-7.el5), but it is at least in the same major version series. I did not update to the 5.1 "GA" (General Availability) release on the server because I did not want to lose the automatic patches pushed out via the [Red Hat](/wiki/Red_Hat) network.

## Other prerequisites

We'll need the mysql [gem](/wiki/gem), which is considerably easier to build on [Snow Leopard](/wiki/Snow_Leopard) than it was on [Leopard](/wiki/Leopard) (see "[Installing the mysql gem on Mac OS X Leopard 10.5.1](/wiki/Installing_the_mysql_gem_on_Mac_OS_X_Leopard_10.5.1)":

```shell
$ sudo gem install mysql
```

And Rack. For some reason, [Rails](/wiki/Rails) complains even when it has its own built-in version of Rack:

```shell
$ script/server
/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/rubygems.rb:636:in `report_activate_error': Could not find RubyGem rack (~> 1.0.0) (Gem::LoadError)
```

So we install it:

```shell
$ sudo gem install rack
```

And now it works:

```shell
$ script/server
=> Booting Mongrel
=> Rails 2.3.3 application starting on http://0.0.0.0:3000
=> Call with -d to detach
=> Ctrl-C to shutdown server
```

Note that to actually do anything useful with the server you'll need to re-create your databases or migrate them. See "[Migrating MySQL databases](/wiki/Migrating_MySQL_databases)" for an example.
