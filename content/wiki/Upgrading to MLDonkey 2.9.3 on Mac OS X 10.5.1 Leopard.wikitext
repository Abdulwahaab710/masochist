These notes were made while upgrading to [[MLDonkey 2.9.3]] on [[Mac OS X]] 10.5.1 [[Leopard]].

= Building =

<pre>wget http://garr.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mldonkey/mldonkey-2.9.3.tar.bz2
tar xjvf mldonkey-2.9.3.tar.bz2 
cd mldonkey-2.9.3
./configure</pre>

Note that seeing as this is the first time I've tried to build [[MLDonkey]] on [[Leopard]], I received the following prompt during configuration:

<pre>--------------------------------
     Checking Ocaml compiler.
--------------------------------
checking for ocamlc.opt... no
checking for ocamlc... no
checking for camlp4... no
********  Objective-Caml 3.10.1 is required  *********
*******  Check http://caml.inria.fr/  ********
Do you want this script to try to download and install ocaml
LOCALLY in mldonkey directory ?
y
Downloading ...</pre>

When that is done (several minutes later):

<pre>make</pre>

= Testing =

To make sure things work first run <tt>mlnet</tt>:

<pre>./mlnet</pre>

You can then test using the web interface (connect to: http://localhost:4080/) or via [[telnet]]:

<pre>telnet localhost 4000</pre>

= Installing =

<pre>sudo make install</pre>
