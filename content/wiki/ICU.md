[International Components for Unicode](/wiki/International_Components_for_Unicode) or [ICU](/wiki/ICU) is a free set of libraries that provide [Unicode](/wiki/Unicode)/globalization facilities.

As far as I know it was originally developed by [IBM](/wiki/IBM) (see <http://www-306.ibm.com/software/globalization/icu/index.jsp>), but now it's an open source project.
