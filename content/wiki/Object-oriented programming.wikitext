[[Object Oriented Programming]]Â or [[OOP]] is an [[object-oriented]] approach to program design employed by languages such as [[Ruby]] and [[Objective-C]].

Data (instance variables) and code (methods) for operating on that data are bundled together in objects. The actual definition of what these instance variables and methods are is found in a class.

For example, we might have a <tt>String</tt> class. The class defines storage for the data (the characters that make up the string) and methods for working with that data (as an example, a method to return the length of the string). You instantiate an instance of the class to produce an actual <tt>String</tt> object.

Both [[Ruby]] and [[Objective-C]] have a message-based notion of [[object orientation]]. That means that calling a method on an object is conceptualized as "sending a message" to the object.
