= Installation =

<pre lang="shell"># yum install gcc-c++ # prereq
# sudo -i -u builder # build as unprivileged user
$ wget http://znc.in/releases/znc-1.0.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf znc-1.0.tar.gz
$ cd znc-1.0
$ ./configure
$ make
$ exit # back to root
# cd /home/builder/znc-1.0
# make install</pre>

= Preparing an unprivileged user to run the daemon =

At the very least, we want to run as an unprivileged user. For bonus points, we could run the daemon inside a chroot.

<pre lang="shell"># useradd -r -m -d /var/lib/znc -c "ZNC IRC bouncer" znc</pre>

= Configuring =

If using an existing SSL certificate, concatenate the relevant bits (private key, certificate, CA certificate) at `$HOME/.znc/znc.pem`, then configure:

<pre lang="shell"># chown znc:znc /var/lib/znc/.znc/znc.pem
# chmod 400 !$
# sudo -i -u znc
$ /usr/local/bin/znc --makeconf</pre>

Additionally, as I am running this on EC2, I needed to add a port to the security group to allow connections through to ZNC.


= Running as a daemon =

The docs (suprisingly) [http://wiki.znc.in/FAQ#How_can_I_restart_ZNC_automatically_.28in_case_of_a_machine_reboot.2C_crash.2C_etc..29.3F recommend] using cron to make sure the daemon is running every ten minutes:

<pre lang="shell"># crontab -u znc edit</pre>

The crontab should have an entry like:

<pre>*/10 * * * *   /usr/local/bin/znc > /dev/null 2>&1</pre>
