[[RubyCocoa 0.11.1]] was released on 4 June 2007.

I haven't installed [[RubyCocoa]] on my [[Mac OS X]] [[Tiger]] system yet, but it's a project I'm watching with great interest because of [[Apple]]'s promise of improved support for scripting bridges in [[Leopard]]. Citing [http://developer.apple.com/leopard/overview/apptech.html this] [[Apple]] page:

<blockquote>To open up the benefits of the Cocoa frameworks to a wider developer audience, Leopard embraces two other highly dynamic languages for use in building Cocoa applications: Ruby and Python. These two languages are an excellent fit for integrating with the Cocoa frameworks, and they both have high quality bridges to Objective-C. These bridges allow you to mix and match Objective-C, Ruby, and Python, allowing you to choose the best tool for the job at hand while using high level Cocoa features such as Key-Value Coding (KVC) and Key-Value Observing (KVO).</blockquote>

I fully expect [[RubyCocoa]] to hit version 1.0 by the time [[Leopard]] comes out, and I believe that 1.0 (or later) will itself ship with [[Leopard]].

The reason why I'm so excited about this is because I'm looking forward to speeding up [[Cocoa]] application development using [[Ruby]], and I can't wait to be able to leverage [[RSpec]] for testing purposes.
