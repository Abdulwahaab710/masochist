See the following page for information about removing Open Firmware Password protection:

-   <http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=106482>

In short:

-   Reboot the machine while holding down Command+Option+O+F
-   At the prompt type `reset-nvram`
-   Enter password
-   Type `reset-all`

Note that in my case pressing the "-" key on my (Spanish) keyboard yielded another character. To enter the "-" I actually had to press the "'" key. Thank goodness for muscle memory.
