[[Wikitext markup]] is my preferred form of entering text in web applications. It's used by [[MediaWiki]] (the software which powers this [[wiki]]).

I've written my own [[open source]] wikitext-to-[[HTML]] converter, a [[Ruby]] extension written in [[C]] for use in a [[Rails]] application of mine. You can browse the source here:
