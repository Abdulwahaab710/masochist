These are new units added in CSS3:

-   `vw`: `1vw` equals 1% of viewport width
-   `vh`: `1vh` equals 1% of viewport height
-   `vmin`: `1vmin` is `1vw` or `1vh`, whichever is smaller
-   `vmax`: `1vmax` is `1vw` or `1vh`, whichever is larger

Support for these units isn't so great — see <http://caniuse.com/#search=vh> — at the moment. Chrome, Firefox et al are good, but IE only has proper support from IE 11 onwards.
