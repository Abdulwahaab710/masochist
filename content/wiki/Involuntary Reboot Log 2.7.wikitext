The dreaded "Saf BB FQ KP"* strikes again.

[[Safari]] locks up after reloading a page with an embedded video on it that stopped mid-playback. I open Activity Monitor and sample the non-responsive process to confirm my suspicion that it is, as always, a plug-in which is responsible.

Confirmed the suspicion, I proceed to [[force quit]] the [[beach balling]] process, and to my surprise, the machine immediately [[kernel panics]].

The average time between failures drops again with the incident, and this machine looks set to be by far the least reliable I have ever owned. On the bright side, at least there haven't been any failed hardware components yet, unlike my last iMac which was absolutely plagued by them, but I guess it is only a matter of time.

= Statistics so far =

* Kernel panics: 2
* Hard resets: 5
* Total failures: 7
* Start of recording keeping: 17 March 2010
* Total days to date: 101 days
* Average time between failures: 12.625 days

= Footnotes =

* *: "Safari beachball force-quit kernel panic"
