= Overview =

In the lead-up to the [[Leopard]] release I started to use branches seriously for the first time. As a learner I made some mistakes (misnaming branches, branching too early) but by the time [[Leopard]] comes out I expect those mistakes to be amortized. Active development will occur on the trunk (for [[Leopard]]) and maintenance work will occur on the branches (for pre-[[Leopard]] systems).
