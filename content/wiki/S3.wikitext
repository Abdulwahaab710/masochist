[[S3]] or the [[Amazon Simple Storage Service]] is part of Amazon's [[cloud]] computing offering, [[Amazon Web Services]].

The abbreviation is the result of turning "[[Simple Storage Service]]" into an acronym, SSS, and then replacing the run of repeated "Ss" with "S3" (in other words "S three times").
