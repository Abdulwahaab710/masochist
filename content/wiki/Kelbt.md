From the [Kelbt](/wiki/Kelbt) project page:

> Kelbt generates backtracking LALR(1) parsers. Standard LALR(1) parser generators emit an error upon encountering a conflict in the parse tables. Kelbt forges onward, generating parsers which handle conflicts by backtracking at runtime. Kelbt is able to generate a parser for any context-free grammar and therefore implements a generalized parsing method.
