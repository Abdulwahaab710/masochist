Git v1.7.3.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.7.3
------------------

* "git stash show stash@{$n}" was accidentally broken in 1.7.3 ("git
  stash show" without any argument still worked, though).

* "git stash branch $branch stash@{$n}" was accidentally broken in
  1.7.3 and started dropping the named stash even when branch creation
  failed.

And other minor fixes and documentation updates.</pre>
