Useful for the [OS X](/wiki/OS_X) Grapher application, which apparently only knows about the natural logarithm (ie. base "e") `ln x`, and perhaps also the common (base 10) logarithm, `log x`:

-   to approximate the binary logarithm (base 2):
    -   `ln x / ln 2`
    -   `log x / log 2`
-   to approximate the common logarithm (base 10): `ln x / ln 10`
-   in general, for logarithm base "a":
    -   `ln x / ln a`
    -   `log x / log a`
