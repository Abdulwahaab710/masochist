At the time of writing you can get an [[OS X]] installer for the excellent [[Consolas]] programming front by installing Microsoft's "Open XML File Format Converter for Mac" from here:

* http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads

At the time of writing the direct link to 1.2.1 is:

* http://www.microsoft.com/mac/downloads?pid=Mactopia_AddTools&fid=9796588D-238F-4694-9598-1AA8D2BECB55

Once you've got the installer, you can extract the font from the package as described [http://www.wezm.net/technical/2010/08/howto-install-consolas-font-mac/ here]. (In short, you inspect the package contents and install the "OpenXML_all_fonts.pkg" from the `Contents/Resources` subdirectory.)

For Windows, I'm told this link might work:

* http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17879

'''Note:''' As shipped from Microsoft, it appears there is a problem with the baseline setting on the font. See "[[Fixing the baseline on the Consolas font on OS X]]" for details on how it can be fixed.
