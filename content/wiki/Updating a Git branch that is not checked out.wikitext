If you're on branch `foo` and want to make branch `bar` point at the HEAD of `foo` without having to first checkout `bar`, you can use:

<pre lang="shell">$ git branch -f bar HEAD</pre>

Note that HEAD is actually the default, so the above can be simplified to:

<pre lang="shell">$ git branch -f bar</pre>
