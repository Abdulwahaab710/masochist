[[Open source]] software is software for which the access to the underlying source code is available to the public. There are many types of [[open source]] licenses, but the most well-known  examples are actually [[free software]] licenses. Note that all [[free software]] licenses are [[open source]], but not all [[open source]] licenses are [[free software]] licenses.

Examples of [[Wincent products]] that have been released as [[open source]] include:

* [[Wikitext]] ([[C]] extension for [[Ruby]])
* [[WinSwitch]] (desktop application)
* [[Walrat]] ([[packrat]] parser generator)
* [[Walrus]] ([[command line]] tool)
* [[WOBezel]] (framework)
* [[WOHotKey]] (framework)
* [[askpass]] ([[command line]] tool)
* [[Clipper]] ([[command line]] tool)
* and various others which can be viewed at http://git.wincent.com/

I've written about my motivations for supporting [[open source]] in the article, "[/blog/embracing-open-source Embracing open source]".
