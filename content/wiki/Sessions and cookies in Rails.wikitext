Do this:

<pre>session[:symbol]
cookie[:symbol]</pre>

Not this:

<pre>@session["symbol"]
@session['symbol']
@session[:symbol]
session["symbol"]
session['symbol']
cookie["symbol"]
cookie['symbol']</pre>

In general accessing <tt>:symbol</tt> will be faster (lightweight class reference) than <tt>"symbol"</tt> (this has to do string interpolation).

<pre>[16:02] wincent: Hi folks, should I be using: @session[:symbol] , @session["symbol"] or session["symbol"] in my ApplicationController?
[16:02] wincent: ah, and let's not forget "session[:symbol]"
[16:02] shaponagota: wincent: session[:symbol]
[16:02] wincent: thanks shaponagota
[16:03] shaponagota: wincent: no more @ on session and params
[16:04] wincent: shaponagota: the docs at api.rubyonrails.org don't use the @, but I was confused because I saw this DHH example which uses the other style: http://one.textdrive.com/pipermail/rails/2005-March/004980.html (evidently that's the "old way" now...)
[16:04] shaponagota: wincent: yeah it was the old way
[16:04] wincent: shaponagota: i guess the same applies for cookies, right?
[16:04] shaponagota: wincent: yes
[16:05] wincent: thanks shaponagota</pre>
