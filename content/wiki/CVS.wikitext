[[CVS]] or the [[Concurrent Versions System]] is a centralized, free [[version control system]] that has largely been replaced by [[Subversion]]. Old projects and existing infrastructure may continue to employ [[CVS]]Â but most new projects are built using a [[distributed version control system]] such as [[Git]]. Many existing projects with long histories stored in centralized repos are also switching to [[DVCS]] systems.

Those looking for a free, centralized (client/server) [[version control system]] choose [[Subversion]]. The principal commercial alternative is [[Perforce]].
