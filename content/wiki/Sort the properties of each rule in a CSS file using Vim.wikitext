 :g/{/ .+1,/}/-1 sort

Explanation:

* `:g/{/`: for all lines matching the pattern `{`
* `.+1`: start at the next line (`.` is the line)
* `,`: and continue until
* `/}/`: the next line matching the pattern `}`
* `-1`: but, specifically, the line before that
* `sort`: sort everything in that range

Alternatively, make a binding to do this wherever the cursor is:

 noremap <silent> <leader>s ?{?+1;/}/-1sort i<CR>

* `?{?`: search back to line with `{`
* `+1`: next line
* `,`: then go until (`;` would also work)
* `/}/`: next line with `}`
* `-1`: get previous line
* `sort`: sort within the range
* `i`: case-insensitively
