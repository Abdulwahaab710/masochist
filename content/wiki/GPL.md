The [GPL](/wiki/GPL) or [GNU Public License](/wiki/GNU_Public_License) is a popular license for free and open source software. It is the license used by a number of [Wincent products](/wiki/Wincent_products) such as the [Walrus](/wiki/Walrus), [Wincent Build Tools](/wiki/Wincent_Build_Tools), [Wincent Strings Utility](/wiki/Wincent_Strings_Utility) and [WOTest](/wiki/WOTest).

It is considered by many to be "more free" than the [BSD license](/wiki/BSD_license) but this is not strictly true. It is actually more restrictive, but in the sense that it imposes restrictions in order to guarantee the continuance of freedom. The [BSD license](/wiki/BSD_license), in comparison, is even more free, but that includes the freedom to deny others the same freedom. That is, the [GPL](/wiki/GPL) ensures that once code is released under the [GPL](/wiki/GPL) it will always remain free, but the [BSD](/wiki/BSD) allows people to take free software and subsume it in closed source commercial offerings.
