<pre>wget http://dfn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/flac/flac-1.2.1.tar.gz
tar xzvf flac-1.2.1.tar.gz 
cd flac-1.2.1
./configure --disable-asm-optimizations && make && make check
sudo make install</pre>

There actually were some minor test failures in <tt>make check</tt>, but they look harmless enough so I proceded with the install.
