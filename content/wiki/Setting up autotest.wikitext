An older version of these notes can be found at "[[Setting up autotest (with ZenTest versions prior to 3.6.0)]]". These notes apply to [[ZenTest 3.6.0]] or later.

= Install [[autotest]] =

<pre># installation
sudo gem install ZenTest

# update fast documentation index
fastri-server -b</pre>

= Set up a project for use with [[autotest]] =

Unlike previous versions of [[RSpec]] and [[ZenTest]], as of [[RSpec 1.0.3]] and [[ZenTest 3.6.0]] no special setup is necessary. You can remove any <tt>rspec_autotest.rb</tt> files that you previously installed (as described in "[[Setting up autotest (with ZenTest versions prior to 3.6.0)]]").

The only prerequisite is that your project should use parallel <tt>lib</tt> and <tt>spec</tt> folders.

You can start [[autotest]] using:

<pre>autotest</pre>

= Tweaks =

No special tweaks are necessary, unlike in previous versions.
