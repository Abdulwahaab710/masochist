These notes were made during the upgrade from [[Ruby 1.8.4]] to [[Ruby 1.8.5]] on my [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES 3]] box.

= Build =

<pre>wget "ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/ruby-1.8.5.tar.gz"
tar zxvf ruby-1.8.5.tar.gz
cd ruby-1.8.5
./configure
make
make test
sudo make install
make check</pre>

= Failed tests =

Two tests fail identically (and harmlessly) as they did for [[Ruby 1.8.4]] (see "[[Building and installing Ruby 1.8.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES 3]]"). I also found that if I ran the tests as root (probably a silly idea), four more tests failed, but they seem harmless enough and probably only arise because the tests appear to have been written under the assumption that they won't be run with root privileges:

<pre>  1) Failure:
test_delete(TestDBM) [./dbm/test_dbm.rb:332]:
<DBMError> exception expected but none was thrown.

  2) Failure:
test_delete(TestGDBM) [./gdbm/test_gdbm.rb:442]:
<GDBMError> exception expected but none was thrown.

  3) Failure:
test_s_open_error(TestGDBM) [./gdbm/test_gdbm.rb:200]:
<Errno::EACCES> exception expected but was
Class: <Errno::EAGAIN>
