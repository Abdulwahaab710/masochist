Ever since installing [[Ruby]] I was puzzled as to why [[ri]] couldn't find the basic documentation for built-in classes like <tt>String</tt>. Typing <tt>ri String</tt> would give me documentation for third-party additions to the <tt>String</tt> class (for example, from [[Rails]]) but would show nothing about the standard methods.

I finally discovered the cause when playing with the command-line switches for [[ri]] and trying:

<pre>ri --site String</pre>

This yielded:

<pre>No ri documentation found in:
     /usr/local/share/ri/1.8/site

Was rdoc run to create documentation?


Installing Documentation
------------------------
'ri' uses a database of documentation built by the RDoc utility.

So, how do you install this documentation on your system? It depends on
how you installed Ruby.

_If you installed Ruby from source files_ (that is, if it some point you
typed 'make' during the process :), you can install the RDoc
documentation yourself. Just go back to the place where you have your
Ruby source and type

   make install-doc

You'll probably need to do this as a superuser, as the documentation is
installed in the Ruby target tree (normally somewhere under
+/usr/local+.</pre>

So I went back and did this as described in "[[Building and installing Ruby 1.8.5 on Mac OS X Tiger]]". Now <tt>ri String</tt> works as expected.
