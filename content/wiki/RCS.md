[RCS](/wiki/RCS) or the [Revision Control System](/wiki/Revision_Control_System) is a primitive [version control system](/wiki/version_control_system) for tracking the change history of a single file over time. Because it only works on single files it is not all that useful for working on software projects which normally consist of collections of many files; [CVS](/wiki/CVS) was developed out of [RCS](/wiki/RCS) with a view to overcoming this limitation.
