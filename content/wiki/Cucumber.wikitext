[[Cucumber]] is an acceptance testing framework written in [[Ruby]].

= Features =

* Pretty output
* Nice integration with [[Capybara]]

= Criticisms =

* Extremely complex implementation with an enormous dependency hierarchy
* Constantly changing API and implementation details mean that, historically, updates usually require additional maintenance to fix breakage
* High overhead required to maintain parallel plaintext "feature" files and supporting [[Ruby]] "step definition" files
* Feature file syntax (called "Gherkin") is marketed as "business readable", but this is of little value because it is neither "business writable", nor any more readable than a well-written Ruby DSL would be

= Alternatives =

* [[Steak]] is an extremely minimal acceptance testing framework for [[Rails]] applications built on top of [[RSpec]]
