[Base-36](/wiki/Base-36) is the highest base representable using only alphanumeric characters for each digit. The possible range for each digit is from 0 through to 9 then a through z (inclusive).

You can use a tool like [WinHex](/wiki/WinHex) to perform conversions between numbers of different bases, up to and including [base-36](/wiki/base-36).
