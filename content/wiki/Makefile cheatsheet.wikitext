= Automatic variables =

* `$@`: file being generated
* `$<`: first pre-requisite

= Functions =

* `wildcard`
* `addprefix`

= Order-only prerequisites =

<pre># "target" depends on "dependency" but last-modified date is not considered
target: | dependency</pre>

= `FORCE` targets =

<pre># "target" always gets built...
target: FORCE

# ...because it depends on this non-existent file
FORCE:</pre>
