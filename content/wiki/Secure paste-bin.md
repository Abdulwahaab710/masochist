I was looking for a "secure" paste-bin with a one-time paste feature (ie. something you could paste to, read from once only, and would then be deleted).

The closest I could find was <https://pastee.org/>, which allows you to set a short expiry on your pastes (ie. 1 hour), and optionally encrypt them with a passphrase.
