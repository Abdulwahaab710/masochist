    Updated to revision 4904.

This conflict was caused because I had previously applied a fix to a bug in version 2.1 (see "[Upgrading from WordPress 2.0.7 to 2.1 using Subversion](/wiki/Upgrading_from_WordPress_2.0.7_to_2.1_using_Subversion)").

Fix conflict by copying newer versions over locally modified versions:

    sudo cp version.php.r4904 version.php
    sudo cp cache.php.r4904 cache.php
    sudo svn resolved cache.php version.php

Now `svn up`:

    sudo -u "${APACHE_USER}" -H svn up

From `svn up`:

    At revision 4904.

# Finishing up

Finally, hit `wp-admin/upgrade.php` and re-enable plug-ins one by one.
