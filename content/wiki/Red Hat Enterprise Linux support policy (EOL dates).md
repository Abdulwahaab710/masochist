[This page at Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/security/updates/errata/) outlines their support policy for their Red Hat Enterprise Linux products.

In short:

-   Full support: first 2.5 years
-   Deployment: first 3 years
-   Maintenance: first 7 years

In the specific case of RHEL 3, that means:

-   General Availability: Oct 23, 2003
-   Full Support (including hardware updates): Oct 23, 2003 -- April 30, 2006
-   Deployment Support: May 1, 2006 -- Oct 31, 2006
-   Maintenance Support: Nov 1, 2006 -- Oct 31, 2010

In the case of RHEL 4, that means:

-   General Availability: Feb 15, 2005
-   Full Support (including hardware updates): Feb 15, 2005 -- Aug 31, 2007
-   Deployment Support: Sep 1, 2007 -- Feb 29, 2008
-   Maintenance Support: Mar 1, 2008 -- Feb 29, 2012

In the case of RHEL 5, that means:

-   General Availability: Mar 14, 2007
-   Full Support (including hardware updates): Mar 14, 2007 -- Sep 30, 2009
-   Deployment Support: Oct 1, 2009 -- Mar 31, 2010
-   Maintenance Support: Apr 1, 2010 -- Mar 31, 2014

Would be really nice to be able to move to [RHEL 5](/wiki/RHEL_5) and forget about upgrading until 2014. As it comes with [Apache 2.2](/wiki/Apache_2.2) standard, things like [Rails](/wiki/Rails) deployment would be a lot more straightforward.
