[[ievms]] is an [[open source]] project that can download and configure the free VM images that Microsoft provides for the purposes of testing IE.

It's a great project. This free tool could help you replace a paid service like www.browserstack.com; if it does, consider [https://pledgie.com/campaigns/15995 making a donation].

For an example usage, see "[[Testing web pages in IE with ievms and VirtualBox on OS X]]".
