Lambdas:

* written using `lambda {}` syntax
* check passed-in arguments against the arity of the block (in Ruby >= 1.9)
* `return` returns from the lambda

Procs:

* written using `proc {}` or `Proc.new {}` syntax
* do not check passed-in arguments against the arity of the block
* `return` returns from the enclosing scope
