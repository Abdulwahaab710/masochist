[[MacVim]] is a [[Cocoa]] port of [[Vim]] for [[Mac OS X]] maintained by Bj√∂rn Winckler.

The editing experience is much like Vim on any other platform (or like Vim on the [[command line]] in [[Mac OS X]]), but the Cocoa layer provides attractive windows, some additional integration with the operating system (things like the clipboard), and some other bonus features such as a full-screen mode.
