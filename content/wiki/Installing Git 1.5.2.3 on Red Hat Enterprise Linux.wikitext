For my [[Red Hat]] [[Git]] install I opted for a simpler, no-documentation installation (for notes on installing the documentation see "[[Installing Git 1.5.2.3 on Mac OS X Tiger]]"). Note that although [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] already has a copy of the Expat library installed (in <tt>/usr/lib/</tt>) I decided to download the latest version and install it under <tt>/usr/local/lib/</tt>.

<pre># get source for Expat dependency from:
# http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/
wget http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/expat/expat-2.0.1.tar.gz

# extract
tar xzvf expat-2.0.1.tar.gz
cd expat-2.0.1

# build
./configure
make
make check
sudo make install

# grab the source from the Git homepage:
# http://git.or.cz/
wget http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-1.5.2.3.tar.bz2

# extract source
tar xjvf git-1.5.2.3.tar.bz2
cd git-1.5.2.3

# build
make prefix=/usr/local all

# run tests
make prefix=/usr/local test
echo $?

# install
unset CDPATH
sudo make prefix=/usr/local install</pre>

My first attempt at installing didn't work because of a period in my <tt>CDPATH</tt> environment variable; to avoid such problems in the future I <tt>unset</tt> the variable and removed the corresponding <tt>export</tt> from my <tt>~/.bash_profile</tt> (<tt>CDATH</tt> should be set via normal assignment only and not exported).
