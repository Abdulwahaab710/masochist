[WordPress](/wiki/WordPress) is a popular [weblog](/wiki/weblog) application written in [PHP](/wiki/PHP). I used to be a WordPress user myself until my growing dissatisfaction with the project's security track record and its unhelpful release management policies (sudden, update-now-or-get-owned releases) combined with inappropriate tracking of security issues (known issues publicly visible in their issue tracker well before fixes are published instead of the other way round) led me to final retire it from service.
