The basic recipe for upgrading using [[CPAN]] is:

<pre>sudo -H perl -MCPAN -e 'install SVK'</pre>

Or if you have a sufficiently up-to-date copy of the [[CPAN]] module (which installs the <tt>cpan</tt> command-line tool):

<pre>sudo -H cpan SVK</pre>

The first time I tried to update I got an "already up-to-date" message. It seems I need to look for better mirrors. I did a <tt>sudo -H cpan</tt> and entered <tt>o conf init</tt> so as to pick some different mirrors, and then finally <tt>install SVK</tt> worked.
