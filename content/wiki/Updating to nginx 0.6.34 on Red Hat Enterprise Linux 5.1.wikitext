These notes were made during the upgrade from nginx 0.6.32 to nginx 0.6.34 on [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] 5.1.

Although the nginx wiki does [http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxCommandLine describe how to swap in a new binary] without dropping any connections, I decided that a more conservative approach would be to stop the server, move the entire old `/usr/local/nginx/` folder out of the way, install the new version, and restart. That way I could back out of the update fairly cleanly and easily if anything went wrong.

Grab the source, configure and build:

<pre>$ wget http://sysoev.ru/nginx/nginx-0.6.34.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf nginx-0.6.34.tar.gz
$ cd nginx-0.6.34
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/nginx --with-http_ssl_module
$ make</pre>

Get ready to deploy:

<pre>$ sudo -s</pre>

Check how everything is going (note that I am using [[monit]] to manage my nginx and [[mongrel]] instances):

<pre># monit summary</pre>

Shut down the old instance:

<pre># monit stop all</pre>

Make sure that it has shut down completely:

<pre># monit summary</pre>

Move the old install off to one side:

<pre># mv /usr/local/nginx /usr/local/nginx-0.6.32</pre>

Actually install:

<pre># make install</pre>

Copy over the old configuration files (note that I have two, one for staging and one for production):

<pre># cd /usr/local
# cp nginx-0.6.32/conf/nginx-staging.conf nginx/conf/
# mv nginx/conf/nginx.conf nginx/conf/nginx.conf.vendor
# cp nginx-0.6.32/conf/nginx.conf nginx/conf/
# cd nginx/conf</pre>

Check config file syntax:

<pre># cd ..
# sbin/nginx -t -c conf/nginx.conf
# sbin/nginx -t -c conf/nginx-staging.conf</pre>

Go live with new server:

<pre># monit start all</pre>

Make sure it's up:

<pre># monit summary</pre>

And we're done:

<pre># exit</pre>
