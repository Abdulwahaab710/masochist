# [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads Grab] [[VirtualBox]] (free, [[open source]])
# Use [[ievms]] (free, [[open source]]) to set up a bunch of throwaway Windows XP/Windows 7 VMs with version of IE ranging from 6 through 11 (at the time of writing):
#* Info: http://xdissent.github.io/ievms/
#* Repo: https://github.com/xdissent/ievms

This will take up a huge amount of space; you can recover some of it after install with:

<pre lang="shell">$ find ~/.ievms -type f ! -name "*.vmdk" -exec rm {} \;</pre>

The VMs you create will be able to access the network, or apps running on the host machine; you can access the latter on `10.0.2.2` (ie. the default gateway reported by `ipconfig` in the Windows command prompt).
