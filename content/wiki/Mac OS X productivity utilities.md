This is a list of stuff that I find helps increase my productivity on [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X):

# Screen real estate management

As the size of monitors increases, managing screen real estate becomes more important. This is especially the case if you're running a laptop and plugging an external display into it, something which is increasingly common nowadays.

For this scenario I use the following:

-   Divvy: <http://www.mizage.com/divvy/> (instantly resize and move windows around and between screens via keyboard shortcuts)
-   Isolator: <http://willmore.eu/software/isolator/> (visually highlights the active window)
-   Mouse Locator: <http://www.2point5fish.com/index.html> (helps you find the mouse when it's lost somewhere on one of your screens)
