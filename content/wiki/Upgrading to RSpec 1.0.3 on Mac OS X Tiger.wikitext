These notes were made while upgrading from [[RSpec 1.0.2]] to [[RSpec 1.0.3]] on [[Mac OS X]] [[Tiger]].

Unlike the last upgrade (see "[[Upgrading to RSpec 1.0.2 on Mac OS X Tiger]]"), there was no corresponding [[Spec::UI]] upgrade although I did simultaneously upgrade to [[ZenTest 3.6.0]] (see "[[Upgrading to ZenTest 3.6.0 using RubyGems]]").

= Pre-testing =

First double check that all [[specs]] are passing for [[Walrus]]. This is a good check because there are a ''lot'' of specifications, many of them containing numerous assertions:

<pre># from the top-level directory of the Walrus source tree:
rake spec</pre>

= Download and install =

<pre>sudo gem install rspec</pre>

I had exactly the same problems that I did trying to install [[ZenTest 3.6.0]]; namely:

<pre>ERROR:  While executing gem ... (OpenURI::HTTPError)
    404 Not Found</pre>

So either [[RubyForge]] is having technical difficulties or there is some other problem between my local computer and the remote host (not impossible given that I believe that my [[ISP]] interposes a transparent proxy between me and the outside world). So I decided to download and install manually just as I did with [[ZenTest]]:

<pre># downloading
wget "http://rubyforge.iasi.roedu.net/files/rspec/rspec-1.0.3.gem"

# installing
sudo gem install rspec-1.0.3.gem</pre>

== Output ==

<pre>Successfully installed rspec, version 1.0.3

= Post-testing =

<pre># run the specs again
rake spec</pre>

= [[TextMate]] =

<pre>cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/RSpec.tmbundle
svn up</pre>

== Output ==

There were no changes since the last [[RSpec]] release:

<pre>At revision 2040.</pre>

== After updating ==

Normally, if [[TextMate]] is running, from the [[TextMate]] "Bundles" menu, open the "Bundle Editor" submenu and select "Reload Bundles". But in this case as there were no changes this should not be necessary.

= [[Rails]] =

I have a [[Rails]] project where [[rspec]] is installed as a plug-in. The <tt>--force</tt> switch is necessary in order to install over the previously installed copy:

<pre># from inside the Rails application top-level directory
script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_1_0_3/rspec
script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_1_0_3/rspec_on_rails</pre>

See if any other changes are necessary:

<pre>script/generate rspec --pretend</pre>

== Output ==

There were no significant changes:

= [[Autotest]] notes =

[[RSpec 1.0.3]] is listed as a bugfix release and so at first I thought it doesn't bring any new features. But [[ZenTest 3.6.0]] is out and it incorporates a new mechanism that offers better integration with [[RSpec]]. [[David Chelimsky]] had [http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rspec-users/2007-May/001700.html previously said] on the [[rspec-users]] mailing list that the next release after this new [[ZenTest]] version will include changes to work with thew new mechanism. This will involve undoing some of the set-up work previously undertaken and described in "[[Setting up autotest]]" and "[[Using autotest with Rails]]".

To my surprise, I found out from the [http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rspec-users/2007-May/001742.html mailing list post] that [[RSpec 1.0.3]] ''is'' the release that brings better [[autotest]] integration.

<blockquote>ZenTest-3.6.0 boasts a new autodiscovery and plugin model that other frameworks can register with and plug into. RSpec-1.0.3 ships with the necessary plugin code, so all you need to do is download and go.</blockquote>

This is really fantastic news. I was pleasantly surprised to see that [[Autotest]] worked anyway without any changes, but I went ahead and removed the now unnecessary customization that I had previously done.

In the case of non-[[Rails]] apps, this amounted to removing the <tt>rspec_autotest.rb</tt> file that I had installed in the project root. As long as your application is structured parallel <tt>lib</tt> and <tt>spec</tt> folders then it all should work automatically. In the case of [[Rails]] apps no changes were necessary at all.
