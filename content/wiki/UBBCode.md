[UBBCode](/wiki/UBBCode) is a custom markup language popularized by the [UBB.threads](/wiki/UBB.threads) forum software (and its [UBB](/wiki/UBB) predecessors). It has been copied by many other forum engines over the years, but it's also quite possible that the ideas were already out there and predate UBB.
