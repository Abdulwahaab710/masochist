[Functional programming](/wiki/Functional_programming) is an approach to programming in which programs are composed of functions that are evaluated rather than executed in sequence. These are not functions in the [C](/wiki/C) sense but mathematical functions of the style `f(x) = y + 2`; that is, for a given input or set of inputs the function describes the result.

This is starkly different to [imperative programming](/wiki/imperative_programming) in which programs at the source code level mirror the sequential execution at the hardware level. Functional programming operates at a higher level of abstraction because it has no notion of sequence of operations and in fact operations don't have any side effects.
