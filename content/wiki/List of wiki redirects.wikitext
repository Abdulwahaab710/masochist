I currently abuse [[wiki]] links throughout the site as a means of quickly inserting shortcuts to key pages.

For example, when I type `<nowiki>[[ticket]]</nowiki>`, that creates a link to the wiki page, https://wincent.com/wiki/ticket, which is set up to redirect to the "new ticket" page at https://wincent.com/issues/new. So in essence, it's just laziness so that I don't have to type `<nowiki>[/issues/new ticket]</nowiki>`.

In reality, typing `<nowiki>[/issues/new ticket]</nowiki>` isn't so bad. But that's something I couldn't do until Wikitext version 1.4.0; prior to that I had to use full URLs (`<nowiki>[https://wincent.com/issues/new ticket]</nowiki>`). That was cumbersome and also caused inappropriate "external link" icons to appear next to all such links.

This page exists to serve as a reminder of which wiki article titles are currently being "abused" in this way.

== Redirects within this application ==

* [[support ticket]] (for opening a new support ticket)
* [[ticket]] (for opening a new ticket)
* [[forum]] and [[forums]]
* [[issue tracker]]
* [[login]]
* [[Synergy]]: redirects to https://wincent.com/products/synergy

== Redirects to parts of the old site ==

* [[Synergy Advance]]: redirects to http://wincent.com/a/products/synergy-advance/

== Redirects to external sites ==

I normally don't redirect to external sites, preferring instead to link to a wiki page where I can add comments and other annotations in addition to a link to the external site (example: [[Subversion]]).

There is currently one exception; as my childhood friend Sho needs no introduction, the [[Sho Fukamachi]] page redirects to http://fukamachi.org/ directly.
