An [[Abstract Syntax Tree]] or [[AST]] is an hierarchical representation produced by a parser when recognizing a document. The structure of the tree itself encodes the relationship between the nodes: for example, the expression <tt>a = b</tt> might be represented as an "assignment node" whose children are "a" and "b"; the "=" symbol itself need not be stored in the tree because the assignment node itself embodies the relationship between "a" and "b".
