`man bash` has a wealth of information on redirection (grep for `REDIRECTION`) but here is a quick cheat sheet:

= Redirect nothing =

<pre lang="shell">$ command</pre>

= Redirect standard out =

<pre lang="shell">$ command > target</pre>

= Redirect standard error =

<pre lang="shell">$ command 2> target</pre>

= Redirect standard error and standard out =

<pre lang="shell">$ command > target &2>1</pre>

Or, as short-hand:

<pre lang="shell">$ command &> target</pre>

Redirecting to a command rather than a file or device:

<pre lang="shell">$ command 2>&1 | mail username@localhost</pre>

Redirecting ''and'' displaying, using `tee`:

<pre lang="shell">$ command 2>&1 | tee target</pre>

Appending rather than clobbering:

<pre lang="shell">$ command >> target &2>1</pre>
