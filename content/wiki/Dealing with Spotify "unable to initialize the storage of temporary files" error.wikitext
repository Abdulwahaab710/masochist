There is a long thread about this [http://community.spotify.com/t5/Help-Desktop-Linux-Mac-and/spotify-unable-to-initialize-the-storage-of-temporary-files/td-p/30293 here].

In my case, the necessary steps to fix were:

# Delete `/Applications/Spotify.app`
# Delete `~/Library/Caches/com.spotify.*`
# Delete `~/Library/Application Support/Spotify`
# Log out and log in again (a full reboot wasn't required)
# Run the Spotify installer

Probably unrelated, but my machine was sluggish and unresponsive after logging in again, so I ended up rebooting anyway.
