[RubyCocoa 0.11.1](/wiki/RubyCocoa_0.11.1) was released on 4 June 2007.

I haven't installed [RubyCocoa](/wiki/RubyCocoa) on my [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) [Tiger](/wiki/Tiger) system yet, but it's a project I'm watching with great interest because of [Apple](/wiki/Apple)'s promise of improved support for scripting bridges in [Leopard](/wiki/Leopard). Citing [this](http://developer.apple.com/leopard/overview/apptech.html) [Apple](/wiki/Apple) page:

> To open up the benefits of the Cocoa frameworks to a wider developer audience, Leopard embraces two other highly dynamic languages for use in building Cocoa applications: Ruby and Python. These two languages are an excellent fit for integrating with the Cocoa frameworks, and they both have high quality bridges to Objective-C. These bridges allow you to mix and match Objective-C, Ruby, and Python, allowing you to choose the best tool for the job at hand while using high level Cocoa features such as Key-Value Coding (KVC) and Key-Value Observing (KVO).

I fully expect [RubyCocoa](/wiki/RubyCocoa) to hit version 1.0 by the time [Leopard](/wiki/Leopard) comes out, and I believe that 1.0 (or later) will itself ship with [Leopard](/wiki/Leopard).

The reason why I'm so excited about this is because I'm looking forward to speeding up [Cocoa](/wiki/Cocoa) application development using [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby), and I can't wait to be able to leverage [RSpec](/wiki/RSpec) for testing purposes.
