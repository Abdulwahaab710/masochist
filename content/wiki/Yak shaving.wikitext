A term originally coined [http://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html by Carlin Vieri]:

> You see, yak shaving is what you are doing when you're doing some
> stupid, fiddly little task that bears no obvious relationship to what
> you're supposed to be working on, but yet a chain of twelve causal
> relations links what you're doing to the original meta-task.

Alternatively [http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html phrased thusly] by Eric S Raymond:

> Any seemingly pointless activity which is actually necessary to solve a problem which solves a problem which, several levels of recursion later, solves the real problem you're working on.
