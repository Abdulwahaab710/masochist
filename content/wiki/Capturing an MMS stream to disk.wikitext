I made these notes while attempting to save copies of the Bill Gates deposition videos, streamed over [[MMS]], to the local drive.

The original links to the streamed content were found here:

http://iowaconsumercase.org/lc-8.html

I then used an [[MPlayer]] command-line invocation to save the files to disk:

<pre>./mplayer -dumpstream -dumpfile gates1.wmv -nocache "${MMS_URL}"</pre>
