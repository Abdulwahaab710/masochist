From the official announcement to the [Git mailing list](/wiki/Git_mailing_list):

    A release candidate Git 1.7.4-rc3 is available at the usual places
    for testing:

     http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/

     git-1.7.4.rc3.tar.{gz,bz2}			(source tarball)
     git-htmldocs-1.7.4.rc3.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
     git-manpages-1.7.4.rc3.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)

    The RPM binary packages for a few architectures are found in:

     testing/git-*-1.7.4.rc3-1.fc13.$arch.rpm	(RPM)

    Except for a regression fix to keep honoring "git --work-tree=/there/ cmd"
    without specifying --git-dir (Thanks Jonathan), there isn't any exciting
    new thing to see here; which is exactly the way how I want an rc3 to be.

    Hopefully we can tag the final by the end of the month.  Everybody, thanks
    in advance for testing this rc ;-).
