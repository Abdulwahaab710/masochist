Abstract characteristics of dynamic programming algorithms:

1.  Small (linear) number of subproblems
2.  Can solve larger subproblems quickly based on the solutions to previously computed subproblems (memoization)
3.  Solving all the subproblems makes it trivial to provide final solution

An example of a dynamic programming algorithm is [Computing the Maximum Weighted Independent Set of a graph path](/wiki/Computing_the_Maximum_Weighted_Independent_Set_of_a_graph_path).
