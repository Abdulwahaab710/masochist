[[Universal Binary]] is current [[Apple]] parlance for what used to be known as a [[Fat Binary]] (from back in the days when Apple started shipping [[PowerPC]]-based machines and you could build binaries targeted for both the [[PowerPC]] and the 680x0 series).

It means that an application contains native executable code for more than one processor architecture; originally that just meant i386 and ppc, but now it can also mean 64-bit variants for each of those as well.
