With recent versions of [[Git]] you can do this with `git push --follow-tags`.

= Older notes =

Normally pushing branches and tags is a two step process:

<pre lang="shell">$ git push
$ git push --tags</pre>

A handy tip was just posted to the [[Git mailing list]] by Zoltán Füzesi:

<blockquote>I use `.git/config` to solve this:

<pre>[remote "origin"]
	url = ...
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	push = +refs/heads/*
	push = +refs/tags/*</pre>

With these lines added `git push origin` will upload all your branches and tags.
If you want to upload only some of them, you can enumerate them.</blockquote>

Haven't tried it myself yet, but it looks like it might be useful until some other way of pushing branches and tags at the same time is added to `git push`. On the other hand, I don't mind typing:

<pre lang="shell">$ git push && git push --tags</pre>
