An [involuntary reboot](/wiki/involuntary_reboot) is a catastrophic system failure such as a [hard reset](/wiki/hard_reset) or [kernel panic](/wiki/kernel_panic). I keep a log of [involuntary reboots](/wiki/involuntary_reboots) for the purposes of measuring system reliability (see "[Involuntary Reboot Log](/wiki/Involuntary_Reboot_Log)").
