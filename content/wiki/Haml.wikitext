[[Haml]] or [[HTML Abstraction Markup Language]] is an alternative templating engine for [[Rails]] that aims to provide:

* [[DRY]], concise, well-indented, attractive markup
* Rigorously correct [[XHTML]] output

Why a new templating system for [[Rails]]? I think [http://unspace.ca/discover/haml/ this quote] best sums it up:

<blockquote>Ruby on Rails pushes so many boundaries: RJS, migrations, and partials were new concepts that blew our minds, and made other platforms try to catch up. RHTML didn't blow your mind at all; it's just JSP/ASP/PHP/etc all over again. Boring! Rails deserves a ground-breaking templating language.</blockquote>
