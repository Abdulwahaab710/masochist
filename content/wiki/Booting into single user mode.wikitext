To boot into [[single user mode]] on [[Mac OS X]] hold down the Command+S keys while rebooting. This is ''not'' equivalent to [[dropping back to the console]].

I use a Spanish keyboard but in single user mode a US keymap applies. This means that to type a hyphen I must use the <tt>?/'</tt> key and to type a forward-slash I must use the <tt>-/_</tt> key.

To check the disk:

<pre>fsck -y</pre>

To remount the disk in read/write mode:

<pre>mount -uw /</pre>
