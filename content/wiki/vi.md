[vi](/wiki/vi) is a ubiquitous text editor found on just about every [UNIX](/wiki/UNIX) operating system you're likely to run across. It has been copied and cloned many times, and now exists in much improved form under the guise of [Vim](/wiki/Vim), the most successful and powerful of the [vi](/wiki/vi) clones.

It's distinguishing feature is that it is a [modal editor](/wiki/modal_editor). Perhaps in the days when [vi](/wiki/vi) was first invented that wasn't such a special thing at all; but in modern times (perhaps as much as two or three decades) non-modal editors such as [Emacs](/wiki/Emacs) and just about every word processor out there today have become so dominant that well over 95% of computer users have probably never seen a modal editor.
