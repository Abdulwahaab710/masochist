[Unobtrusive JavaScript](/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript) refers to an approach to including [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript) code within a webpage in a way that does not intermix the logic (the JavaScript code) with the content (the rest of the [HTML](/wiki/HTML) content). This separation of logic from content shares some characteristics and motivations with the well-established practice of separating presentation ([CSS](/wiki/CSS)) from content.

The code itself can either be in an external file, or embedded within the page itself, but the distinguishing characteristic is that it is consolidated into a single location rather than littered throughout the [DOM](/wiki/DOM). Generally the code will run once the DOM has finished loading, and traverse the DOM (itself unadorned with code) inserting logic and making any modifications necessary along the way.
