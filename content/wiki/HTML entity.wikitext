[[HTML entities]] are a means of inserting a character or symbol into the source of an [[HTML]] document in an encoding-independent fashion.

* <tt>&amp;copy;</tt> should appear in the browser as a copyright symbol: &copy;

They are also used for characters that would otherwise have special meaning within the source; for example:

* <tt>&amp;lt;</tt> should appear in the browser as a less-than symbol: &lt;

[[HTML entities]] can be used to embed any [[Unicode]] character (as shown in "[[Unicode representations of modifier keys]]").

= Other examples =

* `#`: `&amp;#35;`
