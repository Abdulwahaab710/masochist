From the official announcement posted to the [[Git mailing list]]:

<pre>A release candidate Git 1.6.6.rc4 is available at the usual places
for final testing:

 http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/

 git-1.6.6.rc4.tar.{gz,bz2}			(source tarball)
 git-htmldocs-1.6.6.rc4.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
 git-manpages-1.6.6.rc4.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)

The RPM binary packages for a few architectures are found in:

 testing/git-*-1.6.6.rc4-1.fc11.$arch.rpm	(RPM)

Hopefully I'll do the final this Wednesday to make 1.6.6 a holiday gift to
everybody.

I would very much prefer news outlets like kernelpodcast.org and lwn.net
_not_ to say "... is released; it comes with many _fixes_".  Fixes to
released versions have indeed been included in the 'master' branch, but
they all appear in the maintenance release.  The main _point_ of using a
new feature release like 1.6.6 is to get new _features_, so it is more
appropriate to say "it comes with many new features."

Thanks for all contributors who have worked hard to whip this release into
shape.
