Sometimes a programming error will cause a "double free" warning (or some other memory-related problem) to be printed to the console with the following advice:

<pre>set a breakpoint in szone_error to debug</pre>

This doesn't always work. In those cases, try setting a breakpoint on <tt>malloc_printf</tt> as well (because all <tt>malloc</tt>-related error messages do go through that function).
