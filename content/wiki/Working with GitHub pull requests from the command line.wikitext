= Dealing with a pull request from a deleted repo =

'''Scenario:''' Somebody submits a pull request and then deletes their fork.

You can't add their fork as a remote and pull their code that way. The simplest way to get the commit (if the PR consists of a single commit) is:

<pre lang="shell">$ git checkout -b gh/pull/48
$ curl -L https://github.com/wincent/Command-T/pull/48.patch | git am</pre>

Note the use of `-L`, which causes `curl` to follow redirects.
