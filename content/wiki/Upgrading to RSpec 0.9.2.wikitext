Notes made while upgrading from the [[rspec]] 0.9 beta preview [[gem]]. (Note that there was [http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/articles/2007/05/01/rspec-0-9-is-finally-released never any final release of 0.9], the team skipped straight ahead to 0.9.1; they then released 0.9.2 before I even had a chance to install 0.9.1.) 

= Pre-testing =

First double check that all [[specs]] are passing for [[Walrus]]. This is a good check because there are a ''lot'' of specifications, many of them containing numerous assertions:

<pre># from the top-level directory of the Walrus source tree:
rake spec</pre>

== Output ==

<pre>1)
'calling source_text on a message expression inside an echo directive should return the text of the expression only' FAILED
expected 5, got 0 (using ==)
./spec/walrus_grammar/message_expression_spec.rb:29:

Finished in 40.270591 seconds

303 examples, 1 failure
rake aborted!</pre>

Whoops! So there are some changes that have been made that cause one of the examples to fail.

= Download and install =

<pre>sudo gem install rspec</pre>

= Post-testing =

<pre># run the specs again
rake spec</pre>

== Output ==

<pre>/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/rspec-0.9.2/lib/spec/dsl/behaviour_eval.rb:95:in `method_missing': undefined method `context_setup' for #<Spec::DSL::EvalModule:0x14872a8> (NoMethodError)</pre>

Evidently all calls to <tt>context_setup</tt> need to be changed to <tt>before(:all)</tt>. First try using the translator (see http://rspec.rubyforge.org/upgrade.html for more information):

<pre>spec_translator spec spec</pre>

This produces a bunch of changes like these (excerpt only):

So, no regressions at least!

= [[Autotest]] =

[http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/articles/2007/05/01/rspec-0-9-1-and-autotest-zentest-3-5-2 Apparently] [[Autotest]]/[[RSpec]] integration continues to improve. It is no longer necessary to customize your <tt>~/.autotest</tt> file in order to get things working properly. I therefore removed this chunk from the file:

<pre>require 'rspec_rails_autotest'

Autotest.add_hook :initialize do |autotest|
  if autotest.is_a? RspecRailsAutotest
    autotest.spec_command = 'script/spec --options spec/spec.opts' if File.exist? 'script/spec'
  end  
end</pre>

Leaving only this (see "[[Setting up autotest to use Growl]]" for more information):

<pre>module Autotest::Growl
  
  def self.growl title, msg, img, pri=0, sticky=""
    system "growlnotify -n autotest --image #{img} -p #{pri} -m #{msg.inspect} #{title} #{sticky}"
  end

  Autotest.add_hook :ran_command do |at|
    results = [at.results].flatten.join("\n")
    output = results.slice(/(\d+)\s+examples?,\s*(\d+)\s+failures?/)
    if output
      if $~[2].to_i > 0
        growl "Test Results", "#{output}", "~/.rails_fail.png", 2
      else
        growl "Test Results", "#{output}", "~/.rails_ok.png"
      end
    end
  end
    
end</pre>

Before proceeding I also upgraded to the latest version of [[ZenTest]]; see "[[Upgrading to ZenTest 3.5.2 using RubyGems]]". To confirm that [[Autotest]] is still working:

<pre># from the top-level Walrus source directory
autotest</pre>

David Chelimsky [http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/articles/2007/05/01/rspec-0-9-1-and-autotest-zentest-3-5-2 here describes] a patch that you can apply to get [[ZenTest 3.5.2]] working without any further modifications. I'm hoping that 3.5.3 will incorporate the patch.

= [[TextMate]] =

I had an older copy of the [[RSpec]] [[TextMate]] bundle installed under <tt>~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles/</tt> (see "[[Trying out the rspec version 0.9 preview]]"). This was not a [[Subversion]] checkout so I deleted it and performed a new checkout:

<pre>cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
rm -r RSpec.tmbundle
svn co svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk/RSpec.tmbundle</pre>

= [[Rails]] =

I have a [[Rails]] project where [[rspec]] is installed as a plug-in. The <tt>--force</tt> switch is necessary in order to install over the previously installed copy:

<pre># from inside the Rails application top-level directory
script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_0_9_2/rspec
script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_0_9_2/rspec_on_rails</pre>

= Changelog for 0.9.2 =

* Added some website love
* Fixed #10542 reverse predicate matcher syntax
* Added a spec:translate Rake task to make 0.9 translation easier with Spec:Rails
* Better translation of should_redirect_to
* Fixed --colour support for Windows. This is a regression that was introduced in 0.9.1
