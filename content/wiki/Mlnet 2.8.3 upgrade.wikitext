= Static build attempt =
Like last time (see "[[mlnet 2.8.2 upgrade]]") I attempted to make a static build and failed:

<pre>wget http://switch.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mldonkey/mldonkey-2.8.3.tar.bz2
tar zjvf mldonkey-2.8.3.tar.bz2
cd mldonkey-2.8.3
./configure
make mlnet.static</pre>

Partial extract:

<pre>/usr/bin/ld: can't locate file for: -lcrt0.o
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
Error during linking
make: *** [mlnet.static] Error 2</pre>

So I did some Googling and found this (http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2005-04/0403.shtml):

<blockquote>Mac OS X doesn't like static binaries and doesn't include a staticly [sic] linked crt (part of the C runtime AFAIK)."</blockquote>

This in turn led me to "Static linking of user binaries on Mac OS X" (http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1118.html):

<blockquote>If your project absolutely must link statically and need crt0.o, you can get the Csu module from Darwin and try building crt0.o statically.</blockquote>

So I downloaded Csu:

* http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/10.4.8.x86/
* http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/tarballs/apsl/Csu-71.tar.gz

And tried again:

<pre>tar xzvf Csu-71.tar.gz
cd Csu-71
make
cp crt0.o ..
cd ..
make mlnet.static</pre>

Same error:

<pre>/usr/bin/ld: can't locate file for: -lcrt0.o
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
Error during linking
make: *** [mlnet.static] Error 2</pre>

Try adding current directory to library search path:

<pre>export LDFLAGS="-L."
./configure
make mlnet.static</pre>

This yields a slightly different error:

<pre>/usr/bin/ld: /tmp/camlstartup07c8d0.o incompatible, file contains unsupported type of section 2 (__IMPORT,__pointers) in load command 0 (must specify "-dynamic" to be used)
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/ocaml/std_exit.o incompatible, file contains unsupported type of section 2 (__IMPORT,__pointers) in load command 0 (must specify "-dynamic" to be used)
/usr/bin/ld: src/daemon/common/commonMain.o incompatible, file contains unsupported type of section 2 (__IMPORT,__pointers) in load command 0 (must specify "-dynamic" to be used)
/usr/bin/ld: can't locate file for: -lcharset
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
Error during linking
make: *** [mlnet.static] Error 2</pre>

Alternative approach:

<pre>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`
make mlnet.static</pre>

Looks to be the same error:

<pre>/usr/bin/ld: /tmp/camlstartupf55476.o incompatible, file contains unsupported type of section 2 (__IMPORT,__pointers) in load command 0 (must specify "-dynamic" to be used)
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/ocaml/std_exit.o incompatible, file contains unsupported type of section 2 (__IMPORT,__pointers) in load command 0 (must specify "-dynamic" to be used)
/usr/bin/ld: src/daemon/common/commonMain.o incompatible, file contains unsupported type of section 2 (__IMPORT,__pointers) in load command 0 (must specify "-dynamic" to be used)
/usr/bin/ld: can't locate file for: -lcharset
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
Error during linking
make: *** [mlnet.static] Error 2</pre>

At this point I gave up and just did a non-static build.

= Non-static build =

<pre>make
sudo make install</pre>
