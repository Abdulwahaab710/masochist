= Configuration file =
Change your <tt>config/database.yml</tt> file from:

<pre>development:
  adapter: mysql
  database: DatabaseName_development
  username: root
  password:
  host: localhost

# Warning: The database defined as 'test' will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run 'rake'.
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  adapter: mysql
  database: DatabaseName_test
  username: root
  password:
  host: localhost

production:
  adapter: mysql
  database: DatabaseName_production
  username: root
  password: 
  host: localhost</pre>

To:

<pre>development:
  adapter: sqlite3
  dbfile: db/development.sqlite3

test:
  adapter: sqlite3
  dbfile: db/test.sqlite3

production:
  adapter: sqlite3
  dbfile: db/production.sqlite3</pre>

= Manual database creation =

From a [[Rails]] application root:

<pre>sqlite3 db/test.sqlite3</pre>

In order for the file to actually be created it appears that you must execute a command from within the [[SQLite]] interactive shell:

<pre>.schema
.exit</pre>

Repeat this for the <tt>db/development.sqlite3</tt> and <tt>db/production.sqlite3</tt> databases.

= Automatic database creation =

See "[[First Ruby on Rails project on Mac OS X]]" for a demonstration of how to use [[rake]] to create databases and a new (empty) schema automatically.
