Normally I perform [Git](/wiki/Git) upgrades on two different machines, each using a different technique:

-   Upgrading via a tarball
-   Upgrading using a local Git repository

But in the case of [Git 1.5.3](/wiki/Git_1.5.3) I only had time to upgrade one machine before [Git 1.5.3.1](/wiki/Git_1.5.3.1) came out, hot on it's heels. See:

-   Upgrading using a local Git repository; see: "[Upgrading to Git 1.5.3 on Mac OS X Tiger](/wiki/Upgrading_to_Git_1.5.3_on_Mac_OS_X_Tiger)".
