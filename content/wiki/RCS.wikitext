[[RCS]] or the [[Revision Control System]] is a primitive [[version control system]] for tracking the change history of a single file over time. Because it only works on single files it is not all that useful for working on software projects which normally consist of collections of many files; [[CVS]] was developed out of [[RCS]] with a view to overcoming this limitation.
