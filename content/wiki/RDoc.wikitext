[[RDoc]] is, or was, the ''de facto'' standard for producing documentation from code comments embedded inline in [[Ruby]] and [[C]] extension code. At the time of writing (October 2010) it is rapidly being displaced by superior alternatives such as [[YARD]].

Principal criticisms of RDoc include:

* slow
* buggy
* inconsistent
* stagnated development
* ugly default output
* brittle parser extremely sensitive to input variation
* large disparity between capabilities of Ruby parser and C parser, making documentation for C extensions in C files basically infeasible
* inadequate escaping options
