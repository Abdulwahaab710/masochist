This is considerably simpler than building it on [[CentOS]] 5.8 (see [[Building tmux 1.7 on CentOS 5.8]]) and simpler than it was on older versions of the OS (see [[Building tmux 1.5 on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2]]):

<pre lang="shell">$ curl -LO http://downloads.sourceforge.net/tmux/tmux-1.7.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf tmux-1.7.tar.gz
$ cd tmux-1.7
$ ./configure && make && sudo make install</pre>
