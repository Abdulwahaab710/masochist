I was mortified this evening to discover that after reading [http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/documentation/fonts the "Fonts" section] of the [[iTerm 2]] documentation:

<blockquote>One non-recommended font is Consolas. It has an improperly set baseline offset and appears too high. It can be fixed, though; please see this page on [http://mbauman.net/geek/2009/03/15/minor-truetype-font-editing-on-a-mac/ how to fix Consolas baseline.]</blockquote>

I couldn't look at Consolas without being painfully aware of the hitherto unnoticed baseline flaw. Oddly, the flaw in the font isn't visible in [[Terminal.app]].

Getting things working was suprisingly easy, once [https://developer.apple.com/fonts/ the link to the download page] started working and I was able to get a Universal Binary of the `ftxdumperfuser` tool. (I'd been able to find an older download, but the binary was PPC-only; the Universal version came as part of a package labelled "OS X Font Tools Release 4, beta 1".)

Steps:

# Copy Microsoft Consolas files from `/Library/Fonts/Microsoft/` to a working area
# Repair font files using `ftxdumperfuser` (described below)
# Remove old Consolas files
# Install new (repaired) files by double-clicking

The exact edits to be made with `ftxdumperfuser` are as follows:

 ascender="1884"
 descender="-514"
 lineGap="0"

This needs to be done for each family:

<pre lang="shell">$ ftxdumperfuser -h # see available commands
$ ftxdumperfuser -t hhea -A d Consolas.ttf
$ ftxdumperfuser -t hhea -A d Consolas\ Bold\ Italic.ttf
$ ftxdumperfuser -t hhea -A d Consolas\ Bold.ttf
$ ftxdumperfuser -t hhea -A d Consolas\ Italic.ttf
$ vim # do the edits
$ ftxdumperfuser -t hhea -A f Consolas.ttf
$ ftxdumperfuser -t hhea -A f Consolas\ Bold\ Italic.ttf
$ ftxdumperfuser -t hhea -A f Consolas\ Bold.ttf
$ ftxdumperfuser -t hhea -A f Consolas\ Italic.ttf</pre>
