[Depth-first search](/wiki/Depth-first_search) (or [DFS](/wiki/DFS)) is an aggressive search of a graph where each exploration continues as far as possible, only backtracking when absolutely necessary.

It is commonly implemented using recursion, but can also be implemented in terms of a [stack](/wiki/stack) (ie. where freshly expanded nodes are pushed onto a stack).

Exploring a [directed acyclic graph](/wiki/directed_acyclic_graph) using [depth-first search](/wiki/depth-first_search) gives a [topological ordering](/wiki/topological_ordering) (ie. every edge has a starting point earlier in the ordering than the ending point of the edge); this is useful for computing dependencies.
