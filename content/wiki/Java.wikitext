[[Java]]Â is an [[object-oriented]] programming language.

= Things I don't like about [[Java]] =

* It's verbose:

<pre># Java
System.out.println("Hello, world!");

# C
printf("Hello, world!\n");

# Ruby
puts "Hello, world!"</pre>

* It's slow:

As a concrete example, [[ANTLR]] parsers generated using the [[Java]] target run about half as fast as those generated using the [[C language target]].

* It's bloated:

As an example, the [[ANTLRWorks]] instance I am currently running is currently taking up 114 MB of real memory (608 MB of virtual memory) and has 20 threads and 956 Mach ports. For comparison, the running copy of [[BBEdit]] is using 34 MB of real memory (263 MB virtual), and has only 4 threads and 113 Mach ports.

As another example, a just-launched copy of Azureus, when idle, consumes 53 MB of real memory (577 MB virtual) and spawns an astonishing 46 threads, with 877 Mach ports.
