[[ANTLR 3.0]] was released on 17 May 2007.

Finally examples demonstrating the use of the [[C language target]]Â are available. The examples have also been added to the FishEye repository browser (at http://fisheye2.cenqua.com/browse/antlr-examples) but it doesn't look like the set-up is finished as of the time of writing.
