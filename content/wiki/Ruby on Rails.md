[Ruby on Rails](/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails) is a web application stack written in [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby) with a focus on "convention over configuration", testing, and rapid application development.

It is included in [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) (as of [Leopard](/wiki/Leopard)), although in reality almost all deployments target some [Linux](/wiki/Linux) distro and any development you might do on your Mac will end up being with a more up-to-date version that you install yourself.
