From the official announcement:

    Unicorn::TeeInput constant resolution for Unicorn::ClientError
    got broken simplifying code for RDoc.  This affects users
    of Rainbows! and Zbatery.

    I've also made new minor releases for Rainbows! (0.95.1) and
    Zbatery (0.3.1) users to depend on Unicorn 1.1.1
