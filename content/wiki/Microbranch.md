"[Microbranch](/wiki/Microbranch)" is a term that I invented to describe a short-lived branch, often local-only, created for the purposes of working on a single, small feature or bug fix without disturbing development on other branches or the trunk.

I later learned that the term "[topic branch](/wiki/topic_branch)" already has currency for describing this type of branch.

See the "[Using topic branches](/wiki/Using_topic_branches)" article for more details.
