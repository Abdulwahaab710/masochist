[Garbage Collection](/wiki/Garbage_Collection), often abbreviated to "[GC](/wiki/GC)", is a form of automated memory management in which the programmer doesn't need to explicitly release or free allocated memory.

Many interpreted languages like [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby) and [Perl](/wiki/Perl), as well as compiled languages like [Java](/wiki/Java), feature [Garbage Collection](/wiki/Garbage_Collection). In [Objective-C 2.0](/wiki/Objective-C_2.0), new in [Leopard](/wiki/Leopard), [Apple](/wiki/Apple) added optional Garbage Collection to the [Objective-C](/wiki/Objective-C)Â language.
