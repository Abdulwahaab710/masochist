In order to verify the signatures on the [[Ragel]] source distributions you'll need a copy of [[Adrian Thurston]]'s public key.

You can get it and import it into [[GPG]] as follows:

 wget http://www.cs.queensu.ca/home/thurston/thurston.asc
 gpg --import thurston.asc

But don't just take my word for it: go to the official [[Ragel]] website and Adrian's homepage and confirm the authenticity of the public key for yourself:

* Official [[Ragel]] website: http://www.cs.queensu.ca/home/thurston/ragel/
* [[Adrian Thurston]]'s homepage: http://www.cs.queensu.ca/home/thurston/
