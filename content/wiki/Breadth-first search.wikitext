[[Breadth-first search]] or [[BFS]] is a "conservative" graph search algorithm in which nodes in a given "layer" are explored before proceeding to explore lower layers.

It is commonly implemented using a [[queue]] data structure, and runs in ''O(m + n)'' time (where ''m'' is the number of edges in the graph, and ''n'' the number of nodes).
