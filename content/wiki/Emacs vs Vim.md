Both are fantastic editors and they have a lot of strengths in common:

-   extremely powerful
-   once user is proficient, extremely efficient workflows are available
-   active, vibrant, helpful user communities
-   loads of great documentation

And they also have some weaknesses in common too:

-   require a lot of tinkering to set up functionality which users might be accustomed to from [IDEs](/wiki/IDEs)
-   integration with [IDEs](/wiki/IDEs) such as [Xcode](/wiki/Xcode) ([API](/wiki/API) documentation, intelligent code completion etc) is always going to lag behind that of a "true" [IDE](/wiki/IDE)

# Vim advantages

-   a configuration file format I can actually understand without having to take a course on [functional programming](/wiki/functional_programming)
-   fast and lightweight
-   excellent native [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) implementation; no confusion about which implementation to choose

# Vim disadvantages

-   initial experience extremely difficult for people accustomed to non-modal editors

# Emacs advantages

-   infinitely configurable

# Emacs disadvantages

-   multiple competing [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) implementations from different vendors; which one is "the" authoritative one?
-   relatively heavyweight
