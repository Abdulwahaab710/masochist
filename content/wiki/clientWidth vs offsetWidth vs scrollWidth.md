-   Short answer:
    -   `clientWidth` is the inner width (ie. the space inside an element including padding but excluding borders and scrollbars)
    -   `offsetWidth` is the outer width (ie. the space occupied by the element, including padding and borders)
    -   `scrollWidth` is the total width including stuff that is only visible if you scroll
