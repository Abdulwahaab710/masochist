From the official announcement:

<pre>Greetings!

Changes in version 2.0.12:
* Fixed bug: keepalive connection was hanging after upload has been completed;
* Change: if request method is not POST return HTTP 405 in order to simplify configuration.

This release fixes annoying keepalive issue and introduces a small change which allows to process non-POST request in alternative location:

location /upload {
   upload_pass @a;

   [...]

   error_page 404  =  @non_post_request;
}

location @non_post_request {
   # process non-POST requests here

   [...]
}
