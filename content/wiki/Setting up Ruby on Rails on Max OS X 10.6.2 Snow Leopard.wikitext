'''Note:''' These build notes were made while working with a late-2009 (64-bit) iMac, and as such are specific to a 64-bit architecture. For notes made building on a 32-bit platform see "[[Setting up Ruby on Rails on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard]]".

= Pre-installed pieces =

[[Mac OS X]] [[Snow Leopard]] already comes with some of the basic required pieces, such as [[RubyGems]], [[Ruby]] and [[Rails]] itself.

I began by updating two of these pieces to the latest versions:

<pre lang="shell">$ sudo gem update --system # update from version 1.3.1 to 1.3.6
$ sudo gem install rails # update from version 2.2.2 to 2.3.5</pre>

= Other requirements =

My deployment target uses [[nginx]], [[memcached]] and [[MySQL]], so I install each of those on my local machine as well:

* [[Installing nginx 0.7.65 on Mac OS X 10.6.2 Snow Leopard]]
* [[Installing memcached 1.4.4 on Mac OS X 10.6.2 Snow Leopard]]
* [[Installing MySQL 5.1.45 on Mac OS X 10.6.2 Snow Leopard]]

= Application-level preparation =

Once all the requisite pieces are installed we just need to prime the database and we are back in action:

<pre lang="shell">$ rake db:create:all
$ rake db:migrate:all</pre>
