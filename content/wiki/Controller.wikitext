A [[controller]] is one of the three components in the [[MVC]] pattern.

Examples of frameworks which come with [[API]] for designing controllers out of the box include:

* [[Apple]]'s [[Cocoa]] frameworks: Starting with [[Mac OS X]] 10.3 ([[Panther]]) [[Apple]] has provided the <tt>NSController</tt> class.
* [[Rails]] provides <tt>ActionController</tt> for writing controllers; for more information see "[[Rails controllers]]".
