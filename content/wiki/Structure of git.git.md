The structure of the [main Git repository](/wiki/main_Git_repository) for [Git](/wiki/Git) itself is explained here:

-   <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/39954>

# Branches not related to the source tree of [Git](/wiki/Git)

## `todo`

-   A [TODO](/wiki/TODO) list, "not as often updated as it could/should be"
-   Helper scripts used to maintain [Git](/wiki/Git)

## `html`

-   Autogenerated documentation from the tip of the "master" branch, extracted to be visible at: <http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/>

## `man`

-   Autogenerated documentation from the tip of the "master" branch

# Branches that track the [Git](/wiki/Git) source tree

## `master`

-   "Reasonably tested and ready to be used in a production setting"
-   Occasional "feature releases" (eg. 1.5.0) cut from tip of this branch
-   Trival, safe enhancements committed here
-   Never rewound, "so you should be able to safely track"

## `maint`

-   Forked off from `master` when a feature release is made
-   "Obvious, safe and urgent fixes" applied to this branch
-   Maintenance releases cut from this branch (eg. 1.5.0.1)
-   Merged into "master" to propagate the fixes forward
-   Never rewound, "so you should be able to safely track"

## `next`

-   New features developed in topic branches forked off `master` and then merged here when "more or less done and can now be tested by wider audience"
-   "might not be quite production ready, but are expected to work more or less without major breakage"
-   "where new and exciting things take place"
-   reset to the tip of the "master" branch after each major feature release (formely was: Never rewound, "so you should be able to safely track"; "topics that have been merged into 'next' are not rebased")
-   Topics here expected to be "tweaked and fixed to perfection" before being merged into `master`

## `pu`

-   "Proposed updates" branch
-   For all other topic branches
-   Subject to rebasing in general
-   When topics in `pu` reach "testable shape" they graduate to `next`
-   Topics that turn out not to be promising may be dropped from `pu`
