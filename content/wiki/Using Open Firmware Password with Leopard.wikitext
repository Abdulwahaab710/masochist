See the following page for information about removing Open Firmware Password protection:

* http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=106482

In short:

* Reboot the machine while holding down Command+Option+O+F
* At the prompt type <tt>reset-nvram</tt>
* Enter password
* Type <tt>reset-all</tt>

Note that in my case pressing the "-" key on my (Spanish) keyboard yielded another character. To enter the "-" I actually had to press the "'" key. Thank goodness for muscle memory.
