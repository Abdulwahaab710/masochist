== [[Red-Black Tree]] ==

This is a self-balancing [[binary search tree]].

The longest path from the root node to a leaf is no more than twice as long as the shortest path. This makes search a guaranteed ''O(log n)'' operation (insertion and deletion are also ''O(log n)'').

= [[AVL Tree]] =

Another example of a self-balancing [[binary search tree]]. It offers more rigid guarantees around tree height and therefore faster lookup, at the cost of making insertion and deletion more expensive.
