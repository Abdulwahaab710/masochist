Notes made while updating to [[Git 1.6.2.4]] on [[Mac OS X]] [[Leopard]] 10.5.6:

<pre># working from a clone of the official upstream Git repo
git fetch
git tag -v v1.6.2.4

# note: "git co" is an alias that I made for "git checkout"
git co v1.6.2.4
make clean
make prefix=/usr/local test
sudo make prefix=/usr/local install
cp contrib/completion/git-completion.bash ~/.git-completion.sh
sudo make prefix=/usr/local quick-install-man

# go back to the master branch rather than hanging around on a detached head
git co master</pre>
