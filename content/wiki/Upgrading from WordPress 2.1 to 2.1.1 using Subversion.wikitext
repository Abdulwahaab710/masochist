Updated to revision 4904.</pre>

This conflict was caused because I had previously applied a fix to a bug in version 2.1 (see "[[Upgrading from WordPress 2.0.7 to 2.1 using Subversion]]").

Fix conflict by copying newer versions over locally modified versions:

<pre>sudo cp version.php.r4904 version.php
sudo cp cache.php.r4904 cache.php
sudo svn resolved cache.php version.php</pre>

Now <tt>svn up</tt>:

<pre>sudo -u "${APACHE_USER}" -H svn up</pre>

From <tt>svn up</tt>:

<pre>At revision 4904.</pre>

= Finishing up =

Finally, hit <tt>wp-admin/upgrade.php</tt> and re-enable plug-ins one by one.
