[[Server load]] or simply [[load]] is a measure of resource usage commonly used to indicate the intensity of demands upon an [[Internet]] server. The number is an indication of the number of waiting processes waiting to get a slice of the processor time at the moment the load measurement was taken. A load average close to 0.0 indicates that the machine is only very lightly loaded and (almost) no processes have to wait when they want a slice of processor time. Ideally load averages should be kept down near 0, 1 or 2. As the load average gets higher system responsiveness is reduced. Load averages over 10 are very high, and averages over 20 are extremely high.

[[Load]] can also be measured on desktop machines running operating systems such as [[Mac OS X]]. For example, open up a [[Terminal]] window and use the <tt>uptime</tt> tool to view the load averages over the last minute, 5 minutes and 15 minutes:

<pre>$ uptime
18:05  up  5:49, 4 users, load averages: 0,34 0,40 0,42</pre>

In this example, the load average over the last minute was 0.34 (appearing as <tt>0,34</tt> in this case because in the Spanish locale the comma is used as a decimal separator), load average during the last five minutes was 0.40, and load average over the last fifteen minutes was 0.42.

For comparison, here is some output from a server running [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]]:

<pre>11:10:41  up 233 days,  2:00,  2 users,  load average: 0.03, 0.06, 0.59</pre>

Load averages can also be monitored in realtime using <tt>top</tt> or <tt>w</tt> (in [[Mac OS X]] as well) or <tt>tload</tt> (only in [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]]).

Slightly more sophisticated load average reports can be obtained using a command like the following:

<pre>sar -Hqt         | \
 cut -f3,6 -d';' | \
 tr  ' ;' ',,'   | \
 cut -f2,3 -d ','|
 mail -s "Today's load levels" user@example.com</pre>

This does the following:

* Get a list of load averages for the day at 10 minute intervals
* Cut all but the 3rd and 6th columns of the input (columns delimited by a semicolon)
* Replace spaces and semicolons with commas (useful for importing into a database or spreadsheet)
* Further cut the input, leaving only the 2nd and 3rd columns (now delimited by a comma)
* Mail the output to the specified email address
