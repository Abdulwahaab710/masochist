[HTML entities](/wiki/HTML_entities) are a means of inserting a character or symbol into the source of an [HTML](/wiki/HTML) document in an encoding-independent fashion.

-   `&copy;` should appear in the browser as a copyright symbol: Â©

They are also used for characters that would otherwise have special meaning within the source; for example:

-   `&lt;` should appear in the browser as a less-than symbol: &lt;

[HTML entities](/wiki/HTML_entities) can be used to embed any [Unicode](/wiki/Unicode) character (as shown in "[Unicode representations of modifier keys](/wiki/Unicode_representations_of_modifier_keys)").

# Other examples

-   `#`: `&#35;`
