The [[GPL]] or [[GNU Public License]] is a popular license for free and open source software. It is the license used by a number of [[Wincent products]] such as the [[Walrus]], [[Wincent Build Tools]], [[Wincent Strings Utility]] and [[WOTest]].

It is considered by many to be "more free" than the [[BSD license]] but this is not strictly true. It is actually more restrictive, but in the sense that it imposes restrictions in order to guarantee the continuance of freedom. The [[BSD license]], in comparison, is even more free, but that includes the freedom to deny others the same freedom. That is, the [[GPL]] ensures that once code is released under the [[GPL]] it will always remain free, but the [[BSD]] allows people to take free software and subsume it in closed source commercial offerings.
