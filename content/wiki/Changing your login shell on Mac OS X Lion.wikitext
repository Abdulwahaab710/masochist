= Via the [[command line]] =

On [[Mac OS X]] merely running `sudo chsh` is not enough, as [[Lion]] doesn't treat `/etc/passwd` as the definitive authority of user account information, but instead defers to  a thing called "Directory Service" that is managed using `sudo dscl`.

For example, changing your user's shell to `/usr/local/bin/zsh`:

<pre>$ sudo dscl
> list Local/Default/Users
> read Local/Default/Users/<username>
> change Local/Default/Users/<username> UserShell /bin/bash /usr/local/bin/zsh</pre>

= Via the [[GUI]] =

Go to the "Users & Groups" pane of the System Preferences application:

# Click the padlock to unlock the pane
# Right click on your user account in the list on the left, and select "Advanced Options"
# Select the desired shell from the list of available shells

Note that if you've added a custom shell to `/etc/shells` it may not be visible in the list until your next login.
