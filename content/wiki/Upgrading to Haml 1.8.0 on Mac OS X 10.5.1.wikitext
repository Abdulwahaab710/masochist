These notes were made while upgrading to [[Haml 1.8.0]] via [[RubyGems]] on [[Mac OS X]] 10.5.1

= Installation =

As recommended in the [http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/release-notes release notes], I upgraded using the <tt>--no-ri</tt> switch. This suppresses the warning messages I saw last time I upgraded (see "[[Upgrading to Haml 1.7 on Mac OS X Tiger]]").

<pre>$ sudo gem install haml --no-ri
Password:
Successfully installed haml-1.8.0
1 gem installed
Installing RDoc documentation for haml-1.8.0...</pre>

= Updating existing [[Rails]] applications =

== Installing by referencing the [[gem]] ==

Seeing as the project in question is being managed by [[Git]] I did the following:

<pre>cd path_to_rails_application_root
git rm -r vendor/plugins/haml
haml --rails .
git add vendor/plugins/haml</pre>

But if I wanted to do the same without [[Git]] I just would have done:

<pre>cd path_to_rails_application_root
rm -r vendor/plugins/haml
haml --rails .</pre>

== Installing without depending on the [[gem]] ==

If you prefer to tie your application to a known working version of [[Haml]] rather than depending on a [[gem]] installed somewhere on the system (whose version you may not control), you would do something like this with [[Git]]:

<pre>cd path_to_rails_application_root
git rm -r vendor/plugins/haml
svn export svn://hamptoncatlin.com/haml/tags/rel_1-8-0 vendor/plugins/haml
git add vendor/plugins/haml</pre>

And without [[Git]]:

<pre>cd path_to_rails_application_root
rm -r vendor/plugins/haml
svn export svn://hamptoncatlin.com/haml/tags/rel_1-8-0 vendor/plugins/haml</pre>

= Updating the [[Haml]] [[TextMate]] bundle =

Apparently there have been no changes to the bundle recently:

<pre>$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/Ruby Haml.tmbundle
$ svn up
At revision 8772.</pre>
