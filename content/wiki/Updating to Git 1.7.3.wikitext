= Local update ([[Mac OS X]] 10.6.4 [[Snow Leopard]]) =

Notes made while updating from [[Git 1.7.2.3]] to [[Git 1.7.3]] from within a local clone of the official upstream [[Git]] repository on [[Mac OS X]] 10.6.4 [[Snow Leopard]]:

<pre lang="shell">$ cd path/to/clone/of/git.git/repo
$ git fetch
$ git tag -v v1.7.3
$ git co v1.7.3                                                       # "co" is an alias for "checkout"
$ make clean

$ sudo make prefix=/usr/local install quick-install-man
$ diff -u ~/.git-completion.sh contrib/completion/git-completion.bash # any changes to Bash completion?
$ cp contrib/completion/git-completion.bash ~/.git-completion.sh      # nope, but this is how we would install it
$ git co master                                                       # don't hang around on detached HEAD</pre>

= Remote update (Fedora Linux) =

Notes made while updating from [[Git 1.7.2.3]] to [[Git 1.7.3]] on [[Fedora]] 8, again from within a local clone of the official upstream Git repository:

== Updating Git itself ==

I perform this on the two Amazon [[EC2]] instances that I use to host Git repos; note that I use `nice` here to execute the build process at a lower priority (otherwise the build process is capable of raising the system load to the point where [[Monit]] starts firing off unnecessary email alerts):

<pre lang="shell">$ su unprivileged_build_user
$ cd path/to/clone/of/git.git/repo
$ git status                                         # make sure we're not about to clobber anything important
$ git fetch
$ git tag -v v1.7.3
$ git checkout v1.7.3
$ NO_CURL=1 NO_EXPAT=1 NO_SVN_TESTS=1 NO_TCLTK=1 \
  nice make prefix=/usr test                         # as normal user
# exit                                               # back to root
# NO_CURL=1 NO_EXPAT=1 NO_SVN_TESTS=1 NO_TCLTK=1 \
  nice make prefix=/usr install quick-install-man    # as root
$ su unprivileged_build_user                         # drop privs
$ git checkout master                                # don't hang around on detached HEAD</pre>

See "[[Updating to Git 1.7.2]]" for the update notes made during the initial cloning, including retrieving the public key necessary for tag verification.

== Updating [[GitWeb]] ==

As I am soon to roll out a built-in repo browser and will retire [[GitWeb]] I opted not to update it for this release. There ''were'' changes in GitWeb between 1.7.2.3 and 1.7.3 (which can be reviewed with `git diff v1.7.2.3..v1.7.3 -- gitweb`) but no "show-stoppers", so the update can be safely skipped.
