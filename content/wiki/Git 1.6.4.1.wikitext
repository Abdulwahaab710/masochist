GIT v1.6.4.1 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since v1.6.4
------------------

* An unquoted value in the configuration file, when it contains more than
  one whitespaces in a row, got them replaced with a single space.

* "git am" used to accept a single piece of e-mail per file (not a mbox)
  as its input, but multiple input format support in v1.6.4 broke it.
  Apparently many people have been depending on this feature.

* The short help text for "git filter-branch" command was a single long
  line, wrapped by terminals, and was hard to read.

* The "recursive" strategy of "git merge" segfaulted when a merge has
  more than one merge-bases, and merging of these merge-bases involves
  a rename/rename or a rename/add conflict.

* "git pull --rebase" did not use the right fork point when the
  repository has already fetched from the upstream that rewinds the
  branch it is based on in an earlier fetch.

* Explain the concept of fast-forward more fully in "git push"
  documentation, and hint to refer to it from an error message when the
  command refuses an update to protect the user.

* The default value for pack.deltacachesize, used by "git repack", is now
  256M, instead of unbounded.  Otherwise a repack of a moderately sized
  repository would needlessly eat into swap.

* Document how "git repack" (hence "git gc") interacts with a repository
  that borrows its objects from other repositories (e.g. ones created by
  "git clone -s").

* "git show" on an annotated tag lacked a delimiting blank line between
  the tag itself and the contents of the object it tags.

* "git verify-pack -v" erroneously reported number of objects with too
  deep delta depths as "chain length 0" objects.

* Long names of authors and committers outside US-ASCII were sometimes
  incorrectly shown in "gitweb".

Other minor documentation updates are included.
