A bunch of quick-and-dirty screencasts about [Vim](/wiki/Vim). My intention here is not to create yet another "here is why you should use Vim"/"see the power of modal editing" screencast, but rather a collection of short tips and demos for existing Vim users; basically the kind of content that I myself might want to see.

To prevent this from becoming too onerous, or letting my perfectionism get the better of me, I am giving myself permission for these to be rough, unscripted, unrehearsed and, in general, to suck. They shouldn't be more than a few minutes long each.
