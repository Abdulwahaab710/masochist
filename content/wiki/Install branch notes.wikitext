There are no plans to branch [[Install]] because of its nature as a deployment tool it must run on as many versions of [[Mac OS X]] as possible. It was first released when [[Jaguar]] was the current version of the operating system and the intention is to maintain compatibility with all versions from [[Jaguar]] and up.

Even short-lived feature branches are unlikely to be used (see "[[Branching]]") because stability of the code is paramount and the feature set is already complete for most purposes.
