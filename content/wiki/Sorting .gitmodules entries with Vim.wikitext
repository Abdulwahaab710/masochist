Applying a similar trick to the one in "[[Sorting functions by name in Vim]]", we can sort the entries inside a `.gitmodules` file as follows:

<pre>" (1) Collapse each section onto one line.
" Specifically, replace every newline + tab with @@@
:%s/\v\n\t/@@@/

(2) Do the sorting
:%sort

(3) Replace every @@@ by a newline + tab:
:%s/\v\@\@\@/\r\t/g</pre>

Note the gotcha here: `\n` matches newlines in the search pattern, but to insert a newline in the replacement string we use `\r`.
