These notes were made while upgrading to [[Git 1.5.2.5]] on [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] from the tarball.

For notes on upgrading to 1.5.2.5 from a local clone of the central [[Git]] repository, see "[[Upgrading to Git 1.5.2.5 on Mac OS X Tiger]]".

= Downloading =

<pre>wget http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-1.5.2.5.tar.bz2 \
     http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-1.5.2.5.tar.bz2.sign</pre>

See "[[Upgrading to Git 1.5.2.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux]]" for details of the initial set-up I had to do to get [[GPG]] working nicely on [[RHEL]].

To verify the downloaded tarball:

<pre>gpg --verify git-1.5.2.5.tar.bz2.sign git-1.5.2.5.tar.bz2</pre>

Output:

<pre>gpg: Signature made Wed 15 Aug 2007 06:07:10 PM CDT using DSA key ID 517D0F0E
gpg: Good signature from "Linux Kernel Archives Verification Key <ftpadmin@kernel.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: C75D C40A 11D7 AF88 9981  ED5B C86B A06A 517D 0F0E</pre>

Note that although I don't have a trust path to the kernel key set up (ie. I can't verify that key really belongs to the Linux Kernel Archives) my confidence that the key is legitimate is fairly high for the reasons explained in "[[Upgrading to Git 1.5.2.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux]]".

= Building =

<pre># extract
tar xjvf git-1.5.2.5.tar.bz2
cd git-1.5.2.5

# build
make prefix=/usr/local all

# text
make prefix=/usr/local test

# install
sudo make prefix=/usr/local install

# get man pages
wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-manpages-1.5.2.5.tar.bz2 \
     http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-manpages-1.5.2.5.tar.bz2.sign

# verify
gpg --verify git-manpages-1.5.2.5.tar.bz2.sign git-manpages-1.5.2.5.tar.bz2

# install
cd /usr/local/man
sudo tar xjvf full_path_to_manpages_archive/git-manpages-1.5.2.5.tar.bz2</pre>

= Problems =

Somewhat alarming was that after all this, the output of <tt>git --version</tt> was:

<pre>git version 1.5.2.4</pre>

I ran <tt>sudo make prefix=/usr/local install</tt> again and this time it worked.
