Abstract characteristics of dynamic programming algorithms:

# Small (linear) number of subproblems
# Can solve larger subproblems quickly based on the solutions to previously computed subproblems (memoization)
# Solving all the subproblems makes it trivial to provide final solution

An example of a dynamic programming algorithm is [[Computing the Maximum Weighted Independent Set of a graph path]].
