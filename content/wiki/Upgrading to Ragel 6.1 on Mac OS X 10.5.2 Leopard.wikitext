These notes were made while upgrading to [[Ragel 6.1]] on [[Mac OS X]] 10.5.2 [[Leopard]].

== Building ==

Note that in order to verify the signature on the downloaded archive you'll need to have done some setup as described in "[[Verifying Ragel signatures]]".

 wget http://www.cs.queensu.ca/~thurston/ragel/ragel-6.1.tar.gz \
      http://www.cs.queensu.ca/~thurston/ragel/ragel-6.1.tar.gz.asc \
      http://www.cs.queensu.ca/~thurston/ragel/ragel-guide-6.1.pdf
 gpg --verify ragel-6.1.tar.gz.asc ragel-6.1.tar.gz
 tar xzvf ragel-6.1.tar.gz
 cd ragel-6.1
 ./configure
 make

== Testing ==

 cd tests
 ./runtests

Just as in the previous upgrade (see "[[Upgrading from Ragel 5.24 to 6.0 on Mac OS X 10.5.1 Leopard]]"), there is a minor glitch that prevents the test suite from running on [[Leopard]] (although it worked fine on [[Tiger]]). The solution is to make a change to the `cppscan1.h` file in the `tests` directory:

<pre>--- cppscan1.h.old	2008-03-27 00:55:51.000000000 +0100
+++ cppscan1.h	2008-03-27 00:56:06.000000000 +0100
@@ -2,7 +2,7 @@
 #define _CPPSCAN1_H
 
 #include <iostream>
-#include <malloc.h>
+#include <malloc/malloc.h>
 #include <string.h>
 
 using namespace std;</pre>

And then run the test suite again (with `./runtests`) and it should pass fine.

== Installing ==

Now we can proceed with the install:

 cd ..
 sudo make install

== Testing with a real application ==

I wanted to try out [[Ragel 6.1]] on an existing project to see if the generated code was any different. I chose to do this on my [[wikitext]] translator.

 cd path/to/wikitext/src
 rake clobber #Â blows away Ragel-generated files
 rake         # builds everything and runs the spec suite

So all the specs passed, and the generated code was byte-for-byte identical, so evidently my machine didn't exercise any the changes in 6.1.
