The "easiest" way seems to be:

# Turn off line-numbering in  Vim.
# Run `:TOhtml`.
# Write output to file: `:saveas! /tmp/code.html`.
# Open file in browser: `:!open %<tab>`.
# Copy text from browser into TextEdit.app (sigh).
# Copy text from TextEdit.app into Keynote.app.

Note that you'll need to edit your master slides to match the background color of your Vim color scheme.
