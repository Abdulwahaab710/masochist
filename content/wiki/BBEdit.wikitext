[[BBEdit]] is a text editor for [[Mac OS X]] popular among developers and web designers. It's principal competition comes from [[TextMate]].

Personally, I think each tool has its strengths (BBEdit is better engineered for large projects with many files, TextMate looks and feels nicer) and weaknesses (BBEdit is a little ugly, and TextMate turns into an unsustainable resource hog when you throw a lot of files at it).

I purchased licenses for both back in the day, although I haven't used either of them for several years now.

Historically, I tended to do raw [[HTML]] or [[PHP]] work in [[BBEdit]], [[Ruby]] in [[TextMate]], and [[Xcode]] was my editing environment of choice for [[Objective-C]] projects.

Now, I tend to do basically everything in [[MacVim]], and although I use [[Xcode]] for project organization, making build settings and debugging, I actually have MacVim set up as an external editor so that I can use it on demand whenever I need.
