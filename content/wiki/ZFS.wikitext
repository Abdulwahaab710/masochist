[[ZFS]] or the [[Zettabyte File System]] is a revolutionary file-system made by [[Sun Microsystems]] and ported by [[Apple]] to [[Mac OS X]] for [[Leopard]]. At the time of writing, it has never enjoyed "official" status as a supported read-write file system for Mac OS X, and the official [http://zfs.macosforge.org/ project page] indicated that the project was discontinued in October 2009. [http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9x4sb/zfs_project_on_macosforgecom_officially/ Speculation] indicates that this might have occurred due to licensing difficulties.
