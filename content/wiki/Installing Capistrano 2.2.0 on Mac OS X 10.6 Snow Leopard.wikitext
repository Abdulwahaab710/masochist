= Why we need [[Capistrano]] 2.2.0 =

[[Snow Leopard]] comes with version 2.5.2 of [[Capistrano]], but version 2.2.0 is the last know-working version of [[Capistrano]] for me (successive versions included enough pointless code-churn to break deployment) so I froze my old Capistrano install at 2.2.0.

= Installing =

<pre lang="shell">$ sudo gem install --version 2.2.0 capistrano
Successfully installed capistrano-2.2.0
1 gem installed
Installing ri documentation for capistrano-2.2.0...
Installing RDoc documentation for capistrano-2.2.0...</pre>

Running `cap`, however, will cause the later version to be used.

<pre lang="shell">$ cap --version
Capistrano v2.5.2</pre>

= Short term solution =

The older version must be explicitly targeted like this:

<pre lang="shell">$ cap _2.2.0_ --version
Capistrano v2.2.0</pre>

= Long term solution =

Replace use of Capistrano with something non-brittle. Even a hand-coded shell-script would be better. Wish noted in feature request #1376.
