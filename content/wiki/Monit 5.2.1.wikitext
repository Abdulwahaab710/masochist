From the official release announcement:

<pre>Hi, again everyone!

We have been banging our head against the wall all day. Despite severe headache we have managed to create a bug fix version of Monit 5.2. This 5.2.1 release fixes a problem with HTTP and URL protocol tests that always failed if a specific request URL was used; For instance this test would fail:

 check host mmonit.com  with address mmonit.com
    if failed port 80 with protocol http request /index.html then alert

Please download the new bug fix release from: http://mmonit.com/monit/download/ and let us pretend this never happened. We apologize and from now on, we promise to create a big monitrc file that we will use to test every single statement in Monit before we do a release.


Best regards from the Monit team</pre>
