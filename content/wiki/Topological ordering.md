A [topological ordering](/wiki/topological_ordering) of a [directed acyclic graph](/wiki/directed_acyclic_graph) (or [DAG](/wiki/DAG)) is one in which every edge has a starting point earlier in the ordering than the ending point of the edge. It is useful for computing dependency relationships, and is frequently obtained using a [depth first search](/wiki/depth_first_search).
