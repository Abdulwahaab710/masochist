[[Amazon Glacier]] is highly durable, very economical cloud-based data storage for archival purposes. At current prices it's about 12 times cheaper than [[Amazon's]] own [[S3]], and just as durable. The trade-off: it's intended for infrequently accessed data, otherwise the charges start mounting up.
