[Red Hat Enterprise Linux](/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux), often abbreviated to [RHEL](/wiki/RHEL), is a commercial [Linux](/wiki/Linux) distribution created and supported by [Red Hat](/wiki/Red_Hat). Although I wouldn't recommend it for casual desktop use, I do think it is the best option for business applications where commercial support is required.
