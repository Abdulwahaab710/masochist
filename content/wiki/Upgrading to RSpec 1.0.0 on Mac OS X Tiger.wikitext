These notes were made while upgrading from [[RSpec 0.9.4]] to [[RSpec 1.0.0]] on [[Mac OS X]] [[Tiger]].

This release was actually quite unexpected (I was under the impression that the [[RSpec]] team didn't plan on hitting 1.0 anytime soon) but it is an extremely important release because it marks a commitment to freezing the [[API]] and not making any compatibility-breaking changes.

I will use the same installation procedure that I employed when [[upgrading to RSpec 0.9.4]].

= Pre-testing =

First double check that all [[specs]] are passing for [[Walrus]]. This is a good check because there are a ''lot'' of specifications, many of them containing numerous assertions:

<pre># from the top-level directory of the Walrus source tree:
rake spec</pre>

= Download and install =

<pre>sudo gem install rspec</pre>

== Output ==

<pre>Successfully installed rspec-1.0.0
Installing ri documentation for rspec-1.0.0...
Installing RDoc documentation for rspec-1.0.0...</pre>

= Update [[FastRI]] index =

<pre>fastri-server -b</pre>

== Output ==

Building index.

= Post-testing =

<pre># run the specs again
rake spec</pre>

= [[TextMate]] =

<pre>cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/RSpec.tmbundle
svn up</pre>

== Output ==

<pre>U    Commands/Run Focussed Specification.tmCommand
U    Support/lib/spec_mate.rb

Updated to revision 1987.</pre>

== After updating ==

If [[TextMate]] is running, from the [[TextMate]] "Bundles" menu, open the "Bundle Editor" submenu and select "Reload Bundles".

= [[Rails]] =

I have a [[Rails]] project where [[rspec]] is installed as a plug-in. The <tt>--force</tt> switch is necessary in order to install over the previously installed copy:

<pre># from inside the Rails application top-level directory
script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_1_0_0/rspec
script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_1_0_0/rspec_on_rails</pre>

See if any other changes are necessary:

<pre>script/generate rspec --pretend</pre>

== Output ==

<pre>      exists  spec
   identical  spec/spec_helper.rb
   identical  spec/spec.opts
   identical  previous_failures.txt
   identical  script/spec_server
   identical  script/spec</pre>

== [[Spec::UI]] ==

At this point I decided to see if I could install [[Spec::UI]] as a plug-in as well, so as to keep all the important dependencies bundled with the [[Rails]] application itself.

<pre>script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_1_0_0/spec_ui</pre>

[http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rspec-users/2007-May/001619.html Official word] is that for this to actually work it "would need some minor changes in order to work smoothly". So I decided to remove it until those changes have been made:

<pre># direct filesystem manipulation
rm -r vendor/plugins/spec_ui

# or using SVK
svk rm vendor/plugins/spec_ui</pre>
