From the official announcement to the [[Git mailing list]]:

<pre>A release candidate Git 1.7.2.rc3 is available at the usual places
for testing:

 http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/

 git-1.7.2.rc3.tar.{gz,bz2}			(source tarball)
 git-htmldocs-1.7.2.rc3.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
 git-manpages-1.7.2.rc3.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)

The RPM binary packages for a few architectures are found in:

 testing/git-*-1.7.2.rc3-1.fc11.$arch.rpm	(RPM)

Hopefully this will be the last one before the final I'd like to have by
the end of the week.
