= Note =

These notes are superseded by the article, "[[Building and installing Ruby 1.8.5 on Mac OS X Tiger]]".

= Build =

First, download, extract, configure and build:
<pre>wget ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/ruby-1.8.4.tar.gz
tar zxvf ruby-1.8.4.tar.gz 
cd ruby-1.8.4/
./configure 
make</pre>

Second, run the tests and install. Note that the full test suite (<tt>make check</tt>) can only be run ''after'' installing:

<pre>make test
sudo make install
make check</pre>

Print out the version of the newly installed ruby interpreter:

<pre>/usr/local/bin/ruby -v</pre>
