[ievms](/wiki/ievms) is an [open source](/wiki/open_source) project that can download and configure the free VM images that Microsoft provides for the purposes of testing IE.

It's a great project. This free tool could help you replace a paid service like www.browserstack.com; if it does, consider [making a donation](https://pledgie.com/campaigns/15995).

For an example usage, see "[Testing web pages in IE with ievms and VirtualBox on OS X](/wiki/Testing_web_pages_in_IE_with_ievms_and_VirtualBox_on_OS_X)".
