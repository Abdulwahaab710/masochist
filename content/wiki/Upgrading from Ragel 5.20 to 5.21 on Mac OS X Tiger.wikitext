These notes were made while installing [[Ragel 5.21]] on [[Mac OS X]] [[Tiger]].

= Prerequisites =

As noted in "[[Installing Ragel 5.2.0 on Mac OS X Tiger]]", in order to build [[Ragel]] from [[Subversion]] you need to have [[Kelbt]] installed. Alternatively, you can build using the tarball.

= Upgrading [[Kelbt]] =

[[Kelbt]] (by [[Ragel]]'s author) is used when building from [[Subversion]]. A new version, [[Kelbt 0.12]], was available; for more information see "[[Installing Kelbt 0.12 on Mac OS X Tiger]]".

= Installation using the tarball =

I tried to install via [[Subversion]]:

<pre>svn co svn://mambo.cs.queensu.ca/ragel/tags/ragel-5.21</pre>

But the server was down, so I fell back to using the tarball instead:

<pre>wget 'http://www.cs.queensu.ca/~thurston/ragel/ragel-5.21.tar.gz'
tar xzvf ragel-5.21.tar.gz 
cd ragel-5.21/
./configure 
make
cd test
./runtests 
cd ..
sudo make install</pre>
