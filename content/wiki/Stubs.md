[Stubs](/wiki/Stubs) are [test doubles](/wiki/test_doubles) which are closely related to [mock objects](/wiki/mock_objects) but offer a subset of the functionality of [mocks](/wiki/mocks).

[Stubs](/wiki/Stubs) can stand in for other classes during [testing](/wiki/testing) and [Behaviour-Driven Development](/wiki/Behaviour-Driven_Development) in order to keep tests focussed only on the code being tested and not on any of its external dependencies. See "[Independently testing models, views and controllers](/wiki/Independently_testing_models%2c_views_and_controllers)" for more information.

An example of a testing framework that provides a [stubbing](/wiki/stubbing) [API](/wiki/API) is [RSpec](/wiki/RSpec).
