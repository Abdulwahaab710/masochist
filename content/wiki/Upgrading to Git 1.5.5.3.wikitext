As [[Git 1.5.5.3]] is a very minor update from 1.5.5.2 without much impact, I only installed it on my local machine running [[Mac OS X]] [[Leopard]] 10.5.2 and didn't bother with an update on my remote ([[RHEL 5]]) machine. See [[Upgrading to Git 1.5.5.2]] for an example of a more comprehensive upgrade, with info on setting up [[Git]] aliases, ensuring you have the correct documentation build chain, and updating your [[Bash]] completion and [[gitweb]] installations.

<pre>git fetch
git st
git tag -v v1.5.5.3
git co v1.5.5.3
make clean
make prefix=/usr/local test doc && sudo make prefix=/usr/local install install-doc</pre>

'''Note:''' `git st` and `git co` are aliases for `git status` and `git checkout` respectively.
