Not to be confused with [Git](/wiki/Git) (currently the most popular [distributed version control system](/wiki/distributed_version_control_system)) itself, [GitHub](/wiki/GitHub) is a private company that sells Git repository hosting.

GitHub hosts open source projects for free, but GitHub itself is proprietary code.

Free and [open source](/wiki/open_source) alternatives to GitHub include [Gitorious](/wiki/Gitorious), and Git itself, which includes tools for hosting your own repositories using your own infrastructure.
