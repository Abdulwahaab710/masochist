A [greedy algorithm](/wiki/greedy_algorithm) is one that seeks to solve a problem for which brute force search would be prohibitively expensive by making a series of short-term greedy decisions that are "myopic" in nature (ie. they rely on only partial or local information) but which nevertheless sum to produce a result that is both correct (or even optimal, or sufficiently accurate) in an efficient manner.
