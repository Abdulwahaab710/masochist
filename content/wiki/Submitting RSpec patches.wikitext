The official instructions for contributing to [[RSpec]] can be found here:

* http://rspec.rubyforge.org/community/contribute.html
* http://rspec.rubyforge.org/rdoc/files/README.html

I already had most of the prerequisites for running [[RSpec]]'s pre-commit [[specs]], so I only had to do a small amount of additional set-up:

<pre>sudo gem install webgen
sudo gem install syntax
sudo gem install meta_project
svn co svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/trunk rspec
cd rspec

#Â takes a long time... (checks out multiple versions of rails)
rake install_dependencies

cd example_rails_app
export RSPEC_RAILS_VERSION=1.2.3
rake rspec:generate_mysql_config

# requires passwordless local access for root
mysql -u root < db/mysql_setup.sql 
cd ..

# this failed the first time because of a not-yet-documented dependence on hpricot
rake pre_commit

# 
sudo gem install hpricot

# now it works
rake pre_commit</pre>
