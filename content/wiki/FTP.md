[FTP](/wiki/FTP) or [File Transfer Protocol](/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) is a network file transport and manipulation protocol. It has largely been replaced by the secure alternative, [SFTP](/wiki/SFTP), for authenticated transport, but it continues to be widely used for anonymous (non-authenticated), unencrypted transfers.
