[[OpenID]] is a decentralized authentication system that provides an alternative to login systems that use username/password combinations.

Anyone can set up an [[OpenID]] server. I've done this for my identity at http://wincent.colaiuta.net/ as described in the article, "[[Setting up a single-user OpenID server]]".

= Trust =

It is important to realize that there is no trust implicit in the [[OpenID]] authentication model. That is, when I sign in with "wincent.colaiuta.net" the system ensures that I am the person who ''controls'' that [[URL]], but it says nothing about ''who'' that person is. An independent verification is required if you want to know that the controller of a given [[URL]] really is who they claim to be: in the current example you could go to http://wincent.colaiuta.net/ and make a judgement based on what you find there, but the truth is that there is not much content that would enable you to do so. Just as there is nothing stopping a third-party from creating an account on a forum with a username like <tt>WincentColaiuta</tt>, there is no reason why a third-party couldn't register a domain name like wincentcolaiuta.eu or any other similar-sounding name and use that as an [[OpenID]] [[URL]].

As such, [[OpenID]] "identities" should always be taken with a grain of salt. Picking authoritative [[URLs]] is a starting point (for example, in my case the most "authoritative" [[URL]] I could have chosen would be simply wincent.com, but I wanted to have my full name in the [[URL]]), but one should always bear in mind the lack of trust (intentionally) designed into the system.
