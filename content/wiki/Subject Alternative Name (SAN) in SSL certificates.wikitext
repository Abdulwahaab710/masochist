* Clients check the Common Name (CN), but also the Subject Alternative Names (SAN)
* The CN should be included in among the SANs
* This can be used to allow a single IP to support multiple domain aliases (unlike a wildcard certificate, the alternate names need not just be subdomains of the same parent domain); normally you need a separate IP per certificate because at the time the certificate is used the only unencrypted information the server has is the requested IP address
* As you'd expect given the CA racket, getting a cert with SANs is much more expensive &mdash; an order of magnitude more &mdash; than getting a simple cert (for example, [http://www.thawte.com/ssl/san-uc-ssl-certificates/index.html SAN-capable Thawte certs] start at around $199/year); a comparison list can be found [https://cheapsslsecurity.com/sslproducts/sansslcertificates.html here] with prices starting at just under $100/year and [http://ssl.certificatesforexchange.com/ssl/ssl-certificate.aspx this page] has prices starting at $60/year; overall the cheapest I've seen is http://certificatesforexchange.com/
* For an example of a SAN certificate in the wild, inspect the certificate from https://www.facebook.com, or this website
