A [[kernel panic]] is a catastrophic (irrecoverable) failure in the [[kernel]] (core) of an operating system. Kernel panics are generally reserved for failed expectations about internal state rather than external errors; when code in the kernel finds itself in a state which it didn't think should be possible, it aborts immediately rather than continuing (which might produced undefined results).

I maintain notes about my own kernel panic experiences (and other [[hard resets]]) in an [[involuntary reboot log]].
