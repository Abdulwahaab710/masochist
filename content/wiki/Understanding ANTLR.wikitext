In order to fully understand [[ANTLR]] you need to master the following topics. Total mastery of all topics is not always necessary to build a working parser, but without it is very easy to build a non-working one, or fail to even build one at all.

* How to write rules using [[ANTLR]]'s extended [[BNF]] notation (by far the easiest topic)
* What are the differences between [[lexers]], [[parsers]] and [[tree parsers]]
* How [[ANTLR]]-generated recognizers work at runtime; and as sub-topics:
** How [[ANTLR]]-generated recognizers use prediction
** The role of [[predicates]] (these seem simple at first but predicates can wind up in other rules' decision making logic and so the inter-rule interactions can be very, very complex)
** "First" and "follow" sets
* How [[ANTLR]] performs analysis of a grammar
