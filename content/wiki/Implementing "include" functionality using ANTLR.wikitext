As of [http://fisheye2.cenqua.com/changelog/antlr-examples/?cs=3834 changeset 3834] in the [[ANTLR examples]] repository, the [[C]] example shows how to use the new built-in stream stacking functionality in the [[C target]] to implement "include" functionality. 

Note that [[ANTLR]] 3.0 does ''not'' include the stream stacking support. Any version after [http://fisheye2.cenqua.com/changelog/antlr/?cs=3839 changeset 3839] should be fine, or [[ANTLR 3.0.1]] when it is released (not yet released at the time of writing, 20 June 2007).

This supersedes the previous method (see '[[Manually implementing "include" functionality using ANTLR]]').
