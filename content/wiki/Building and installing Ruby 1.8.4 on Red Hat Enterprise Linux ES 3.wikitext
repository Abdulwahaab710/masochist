= Note =

These notes are superseded by the article, "[[Building and installing Ruby 1.8.5 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES 3]]".

= Build =

<pre>wget ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/ruby-1.8.4.tar.gz
tar zxvf ruby-1.8.4.tar.gz
cd ruby-1.8.4
./configure
make
make test
sudo make install
make check</pre>

= Failed tests =

<pre>  1) Failure:
test_s_open_no_create(TestGDBM) [./gdbm/test_gdbm.rb:94]:
<nil> expected but was
<#<GDBM:0xb6be0490>>.</pre>

The source code for the <tt>test_gdbm.rb</tt> file notes that:

<pre># this test is failed on libgdbm 1.8.0</pre>

And the version of libgdbm installed on [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] ES release 3 (Taroon Update 8) is indeed <tt>gdbm-1.8.0-20</tt> so I believe the message is probably harmless.

<pre>  2) Failure:
test_verify(OpenSSL::TestX509Store) [./openssl/test_x509store.rb:169]:
This test is expected to be success with OpenSSL 0.9.7c or later.
<true> expected but was
<false>.

1356 tests, 15391 assertions, 2 failures, 0 errors
make: *** [test-all] Error 1</pre>

It's possible that this second test fails because of the version of OpenSSL installed on the server; <tt>openssl-0.9.7a-33.17</tt>, which is up-to-date with ES release 3 (Taroon Update 8) of [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]]. I believe it is probably a harmless warning, although I can't find any confirmation of that fact on the web.
