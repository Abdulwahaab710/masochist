[Object Oriented Programming](/wiki/Object_Oriented_Programming)Â or [OOP](/wiki/OOP) is an [object-oriented](/wiki/object-oriented) approach to program design employed by languages such as [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby) and [Objective-C](/wiki/Objective-C).

Data (instance variables) and code (methods) for operating on that data are bundled together in objects. The actual definition of what these instance variables and methods are is found in a class.

For example, we might have a `String` class. The class defines storage for the data (the characters that make up the string) and methods for working with that data (as an example, a method to return the length of the string). You instantiate an instance of the class to produce an actual `String` object.

Both [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby) and [Objective-C](/wiki/Objective-C) have a message-based notion of [object orientation](/wiki/object_orientation). That means that calling a method on an object is conceptualized as "sending a message" to the object.
