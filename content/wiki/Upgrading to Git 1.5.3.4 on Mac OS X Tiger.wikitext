tags: tiger git updates os.x

These notes were made while upgrading to [[Git 1.5.3.4]] on [[Mac OS X]] [[Tiger]], using a local clone of the central [[Git]] repository. I didn't perform the same upgrade on the server (which is still running [[Git 1.5.3.2]]) because none of the changes really benefit in that setting (not actively working from that machine; just using it to host a central repository).
