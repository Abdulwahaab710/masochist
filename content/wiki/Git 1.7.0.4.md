    Git v1.7.0.4 Release Notes
    ==========================

    Fixes since v1.7.0.3
    --------------------

    * Optimized ntohl/htonl on big-endian machines were broken.

    * Color values given to "color.<cmd>.<slot>" configuration can now have
      more than one attributes (e.g. "bold ul").

    * "git add -u nonexistent-path" did not complain.

    * "git apply --whitespace=fix" didn't work well when an early patch in
      a patch series adds trailing blank lines and a later one depended on
      such a block of blank lines at the end.

    * "git fast-export" didn't check error status and stop when marks file
      cannot be opened.

    * "git format-patch --ignore-if-in-upstream" gave unwarranted errors
      when the range was empty, instead of silently finishing.

    * "git remote prune" did not detect remote tracking refs that became
      dangling correctly.

    And other minor fixes and documentation updates.
