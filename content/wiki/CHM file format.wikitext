= Converting [[CHM]] files to [[HTML]] for use on [[Mac OS X]] =

My usual routine for decompiling [[CHM]] archives is to do the following:

# Fire up [[Windows XP]] in [[Parallels]].
# From the "Start" menu, navigate to "All Programs", "HTML Help Workshop", "HTML Help Workshop" (see download link below).
# From the "File" menu, select "Decompile".
# Choose source [[CHM]] file and desired output folder and hit the "OK" button.
# This will produce an incomprehensibly named set of files and folders; I generally stick everything in a folder to keep it out of sight, and create an alias to the contents file (discovered using trial and error).

== Tools from [[Microsoft]] ==

* '''HtmlHelp.exe''': downloadable from: http://www.microsoft.com/office/orkarchive/XPddl.htm
* '''hh.exe''': included with [[Windows]]
