[[Ragel 6.1]] was released on 26 March 2008.

== Changelog (excerpt) ==

 -Scanners now ensure that any leaving actions at the end of a pattern are
  executed. They are always executed before the pattern action.
 -Added an option -d for turning off the removal of duplicate actions from
  actions lists.
 -Need to unset the final state status of the start state in kleene star if it
  is set. It is possible to crash ragel when the warning is ignored.
 -In the dot file generation we need to print any actions that are in
  State::eofTrans. These come from scanners only.
 -Use @docdir@ for the docdir Makefile variable.
 -Check for ar and ranlib in the configure script.
