[Akephalos](/wiki/Akephalos) was a great little [Capybara](/wiki/Capybara) driver that wrapped [HtmlUnit](/wiki/HtmlUnit) to provide a [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript)-aware, headless browser for full-stack acceptance testing which was an order of magnitude faster than the then-incumbent king, Selenium.

Unfortunately, Akephalos now looks to be abandonware. Luckily, even nicer things have sprung up in its wake, the best of which currently appears to be [capybara-webkit](/wiki/capybara-webkit), which is more than twice as fast in my testing and just as reliable.
