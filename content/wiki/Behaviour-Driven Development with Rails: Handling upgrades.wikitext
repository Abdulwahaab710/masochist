The general procedure for handling upgrades in the [[Behaviour-Driven Development]] cycle fits within the [[continuous integration]] style.

Prior to the upgrade, all [[specs]] should be passing (as verified by [[Autotest]]).

We stop [[Autotest]] and then perform the upgrade (or upgrades). For example, see:

* [[Upgrading to Heckle 1.4.0 on Mac OS X Tiger]]
* [[Upgrading to RSpec 1.0.0 on Mac OS X Tiger]]
* [[Upgrading to Spec::UI 0.2.2 on Mac OS X Tiger]]

Finally, we resume [[Autotest]] and everything should just keep working.
