Universally regarded as the most annoying app ever, I finally thought I'd found out how to permanently disable it [here](http://sharechair.wordpress.com/2013/01/02/how-to-stop-annoying-game-center-pop-ups-on-the-iphone-and-ipad/):

1.  `Settings`
2.  `General`
3.  `Restrictions`
4.  `Game Center` (two settings): switch to "Off"

Alas, even after a reboot, this doesn't work.

This other guy [suggests](https://discussions.apple.com/message/21181332#21181332) creating a bogus Apple ID, just for the Game Center. I haven't tried that.
