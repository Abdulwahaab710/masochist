Normally I perform [[Git]] upgrades on two different machines, each using a different technique:

* Upgrading via a tarball
* Upgrading using a local Git repository

But in the case of [[Git 1.5.3]] I only had time to upgrade one machine before [[Git 1.5.3.1]] came out, hot on it's heels. See:

* Upgrading using a local Git repository; see: "[[Upgrading to Git 1.5.3 on Mac OS X Tiger]]".
