Assuming an [[nginx]] installation under `/usr/nginx`:

 /usr/nginx/sbin/nginx -t -c /usr/nginx/conf/nginx.conf

Note that the path to the config file must be an absolute one, or one relative to the `prefix` directory where nginx was installed (in this case, `/usr/nginx`), so this will also work:

 /usr/nginx/sbin/nginx -t -c conf/nginx.conf
