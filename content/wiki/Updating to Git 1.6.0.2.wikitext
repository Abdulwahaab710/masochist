These were notes made while updating to [[Git 1.6.0.2]].

== Local update ==

This was the update performed on my local machine running [[Mac OS X]] [[Leopard]] 10.5.4. It was built from source (local clone of official [[Git]] repository).

<pre>git fetch
git tag -v v1.6.0.2
git co v1.6.0.2
make clean
make prefix=/usr/local test doc
sudo make prefix=/usr/local install install-doc > install-1.6.0.2.txt
cp contrib/completion/git-completion.bash ~/.git-completion.sh</pre>

'''Note:''' `git co` is an alias for `git checkout` (see [[Git quickstart]] for details on setting up aliases). See [[Setting up the Git documentation build chain on Mac OS X Leopard]] for details on setting up the prerequisites for building the docs.

== Remote update ==

Seeing as none of the changes in 1.6.0.2 seemed to affect server-side operation I didn't apply this update on the remote server. (For an example of a remote update, see "[[Updating to Git 1.6.0.1]]").
