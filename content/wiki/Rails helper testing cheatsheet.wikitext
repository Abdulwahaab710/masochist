* [[RSpec 2]] (spec framework)
* [[RR]] ([[mocking]] library)
* [[Factory Girl]] ([[object mother]] library)
* [[Rails 3]] (application framework)

= Mocking and stubbing =

Although helper methods are mixed into the example group itself:

<pre lang="ruby">describe FooHelper do
  describe '#funky_method' do
    it 'returns true' do
      funky_method.should be_true
    end
  end
end</pre>

If you need to set up mock expectations you will need to use the explicit `helper` instance that is available inside example groups:

<pre lang="ruby">it 'delegates to #foo_method' do
  mock(helper).foo_method
  helper.funky_method
end</pre>
