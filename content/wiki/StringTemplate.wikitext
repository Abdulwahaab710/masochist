From the [[StringTemplate]] website:

<blockquote>StringTemplate is a java template engine (with ports for C# and [[Python]]) for generating source code, web pages, emails, or any other formatted text output. StringTemplate is particularly good at multi-targeted code generators, multiple site skins, and internationalization/localization. It evolved over years of effort developing jGuru.com. StringTemplate also generates this website and powers the [[ANTLR]] v3 code generator. Its distinguishing characteristic is that it strictly enforces [[model]]-[[view]] separation unlike other engines.</blockquote>
