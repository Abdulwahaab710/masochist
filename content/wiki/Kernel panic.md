A [kernel panic](/wiki/kernel_panic) is a catastrophic (irrecoverable) failure in the [kernel](/wiki/kernel) (core) of an operating system. Kernel panics are generally reserved for failed expectations about internal state rather than external errors; when code in the kernel finds itself in a state which it didn't think should be possible, it aborts immediately rather than continuing (which might produced undefined results).

I maintain notes about my own kernel panic experiences (and other [hard resets](/wiki/hard_resets)) in an [involuntary reboot log](/wiki/involuntary_reboot_log).
