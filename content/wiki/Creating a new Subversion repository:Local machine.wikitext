This is the procedure I use for creating a new repository on my local machine.

= Repository creation =

<pre>sudo svnadmin create ~/Developer/svnrep/project-name
sudo chown -R svn:svn ~/Developer/svnrep/project-name</pre>

I've also made a script, <tt>new-repository.sh</tt> as a shortcut for this operation.

= Initial import =

<pre>mkdir trunk tags branches
mv "project-files" trunk/
svn import http://localhost:8080/svnrep/preoject-name</pre>

= Initial checkout of working copy =

<pre>mkdir pre-import
mv branches tags trunk pre-import/
svn co http://localhost:8080/svnrep/project-name/trunk trunk</pre>
