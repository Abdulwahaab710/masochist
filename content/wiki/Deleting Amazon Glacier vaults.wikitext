Amazon Glacier vaults are notoriously hard to delete, because they can't be deleted until empty, getting a list of their contents is a multi-hour operation, and they can grow to be immensely large, requiring a lot of time to actually delete the contained archives.

For this purpose, I use the `[https://github.com/vsespb/mt-aws-glacier mt-aws-glacier]` tool.

= Installing the tool =

This is how I installed the tool on my [[OS X]] [[Mavericks]] box:

<pre lang="shell">$ sudo cpan -i JSON::XS
$ sudo cpan -i Bundle::LWP # this is the p5-libwww-perl mentioned in the README
$ sudo cpan -i App::MtAws</pre>

Remember to recoil in horror as you realize that this pollutes `/usr/local/bin` (which [[Homebrew]] prefers to keep all to itself).

= Prepare your credentials =

<pre lang="shell">$ cat > glacier.cfg <<HEREDOC
key=YOURKEY
secret=YOURSECRET
region=us-east-1
protocol=http
HEREDOC</pre>

= Prepare a list of vaults to be deleted =

<pre lang="shell">$ VAULTS="somevault
someothervault
yetanothervault
onemorevault"</pre>

= Request a list of archives in each vault =

<pre lang="shell">$ echo $VAULTS | while read VAULT; do
  echo "'$VAULT'"
  mtglacier retrieve-inventory --config glacier.cfg --vault $VAULT
done</pre>

= Download the inventory =

After 4 or 5 hours, you should be able to download the requested inventories:

<pre lang="shell">$ echo $VAULTS | while read VAULT; do
  echo "'$VAULT'"
  mtglacier download-inventory --config glacier.cfg --vault $VAULT --new-journal $VAULT-journal.log
done</pre>

'''Note:''' If you have to retry this step at any point remember to delete your `*-journal.log` files; `mtglacier` will complain if you don't.

= Delete the archives from the vaults =

<pre lang="shell">$ echo $VAULTS | while read VAULT; do
  echo "'$VAULT'"
  mtglacier purge-vault --config glacier.cfg --vault $VAULT --journal $VAULT-journal.log
done</pre>

= Delete the vaults =

Supposedly you might have to wait 24-48 hours before doing this, but I suspect it may work immediately:

<pre lang="shell">$ echo $VAULTS | while read VAULT; do
  echo "'$VAULT'"
  mtglacier delete-vault $VAULT --config glacier.cfg
done</pre>

= Cleaning up after yourself =

<pre lang="shell">$ rm glacier.cfg *-journal.log</pre>

= General observations =

In my case I had about 700k archives and 8 vaults to delete, and it took about 3 days in all. I had to restart the operation two or three times, re-requesting the inventories (and waiting hours before they were ready) each time.
