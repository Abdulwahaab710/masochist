In this article I describe a couple of the alternatives to [[mkmf]] that I learnt about while exploring some questions about [[mkmf]]. The questions were:

* "Doing rake-like stuff with mkmf?": http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.ruby/browse_thread/thread/6c11ef6b608e03d8/
* "Forcing mkmf to use static libraries instead of dynamic ones": http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.ruby/browse_thread/thread/7342fead8ff64c59/

= [[mkrf]] =

[[mkrf]] is a replacement for [[mkmf]] written by [[Kevin Clark]]. It was a [[Google]] Summer of Code project in 2006. It creates [[Rakefiles]] instead of [[Makefiles]].

* http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2006/06/mkmf_mkrf.html

The author has stated that he'd like to see [[mkrf]] absorbed into [[Rake]] itself. At the time of writing, the latest release of [[mkrf]] is version 0.2.1 (released 14 April 2007).

= [[mkmf2]] =

[[mkmf2]] also aims to replace [[mkmf]] but still creates [[Makefiles]]Â (not [[Rakefiles]]).
