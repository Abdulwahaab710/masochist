When I recently wrote a [[weblog]] [http://wincent.com/a/about/wincent/weblog/archives/2007/10/appkit_vs_found.php entry] about the difficulty of working with NSView subclasses Gus Mueller of [http://flyingmeat.com/ Flying Meat] was kind enough to send [http://borkware.com/quickies/single?id=205 this link] to me.

In short, you can get [[AppKit]] to highlight all views in an application, with nested subviews in different colors.

<pre>#Â method 1: set persistent user defaults
defaults write com.wincent.MyAppBundleIdentifier NSShowAllViews YES

# method 2: pass default at launch time
Example.app/Contents/MacOS/Example -NSShowAllViews YES</pre>
