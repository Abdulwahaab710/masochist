# Official site

-   <http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/>

# Advantages

-   nice toys like list comprehensions

# Disadvantages

-   adds a compilation step
-   no native browser support yet (source maps can be used to get CoffeeScript visible in the debugger, but you can't type CoffeeScript in the browser console)
-   language designed for [writability but not readability](http://ceronman.com/2012/08/20/beyond-javascript-coffeescript/) (compare that with [Knuth's](http://www.cs.uky.edu/~keen/115/quotes) proposal: "Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs. Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to to, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do."):
    -   multiple ways to do things
    -   implicit considered better than explicit; parentheses, braces, commas and other elements are (often) optional
