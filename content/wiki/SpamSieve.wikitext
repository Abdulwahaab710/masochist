[[SpamSieve]] is  a fantastic anti-spam tool for [[Mac OS X]]. I have used it with great success since 2004 to reliably filter a very large amount of incoming mail.

As of January 2010, it has made email life bearable even in the face of over 280 spam messages per day, and has maintained an accuracy of very close to 100% (see [/blog/state-of-the-spam-ion-2010-address this post] for full details).
