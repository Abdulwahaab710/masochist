[Amazon Glacier](/wiki/Amazon_Glacier) is highly durable, very economical cloud-based data storage for archival purposes. At current prices it's about 12 times cheaper than [Amazon's](/wiki/Amazon%27s) own [S3](/wiki/S3), and just as durable. The trade-off: it's intended for infrequently accessed data, otherwise the charges start mounting up.
