[Unit testing](/wiki/Unit_testing) is typically used as either:

1.  A general term used to describe any automated-testing procedure that performs tests on a piece of software and checks to make sure that the obtained results meet the expectations defined by the programmer.
2.  More specifically, [unit testing](/wiki/unit_testing) may refer to a specific kind of test, the [unit test](/wiki/unit_test), which is a low-level test that checks the operation of a piece of code at the lowest possible level external to the code itself. In the case of [object-oriented programming](/wiki/object-oriented_programming) the lowest level of externally visible, testable functionality is usually a single method; so in this case "[unit tests](/wiki/unit_tests)" usually refers to test which check the operation of an individual method.

Other related terms include [functional tests](/wiki/functional_tests) and [acceptance tests](/wiki/acceptance_tests).

I've written my own framework for [unit testing](/wiki/unit_testing) [Objective-C](/wiki/Objective-C) code, [WOTest](/wiki/WOTest).

[Unit testing](/wiki/Unit_testing) is an integral part of the [continuous integration](/wiki/continuous_integration) development process.
