"[[Microbranch]]" is a term that I invented to describe a short-lived branch, often local-only, created for the purposes of working on a single, small feature or bug fix without disturbing development on other branches or the trunk.

I later learned that the term "[[topic branch]]" already has currency for describing this type of branch.

See the "[[Using topic branches]]" article for more details.
