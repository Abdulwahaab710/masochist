As [http://www.friday.com/bbum/2006/09/12/subversion-14-adds-keychain-support/ noted here], to switch to Keychain-based storage of Subversion passwords (requires [[Subversion]] 1.4.0 or later), you need only remove your <tt>~/.subversion/auth/svn.simple</tt> directory. You'll be prompted for the passwords again the next time you access those repositories, but from that point on they'll be stored in the Keychain.
