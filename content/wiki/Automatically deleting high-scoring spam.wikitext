= Efficacy =

This auto-deletion system intercepted 749 messages to my business account and 8 messages to my personal account in a test period of just under sixteen days (late June/early July of 2006) with no false positives. This equates to an average block count of just over 47 messages per day.

For other efficacy statistics see [[combatting spam]].
