Start up a server on the localhost listening to some arbitrary port:

 memcached -l 127.0.0.1 -p 12345 -m 64 -vv

The `-m 64` switch is really just there for explicitness, seeing as [[memcached]] defaults to using 64MB of memory by default anyway.

`-vv` turns on verbose logging so that we can see what's happening.

If the `-p` switch is omitted [[memcached]] will use the default port of 11211.

Now from another console login via telnet:

 telnet localhost 12345

We can issue `get` commands:

 get greeting
 END

So nothing was found. Now let's store something:

 set greeting 1 0 11
 Hello world
 STORED

That means, "use key `greeting`, use `1` as flag (arbitrary metadata), use `0` as the expiry (ie. never expire), and expect the value to be 11 bytes long".

Now we can get the value back out:

 get greeting
 VALUE greeting 1 11
 Hello world
 END

And we're done:

 quit

= Other commands =

 stats
 stats items
 stats slabs
 delete
 replace
 add
