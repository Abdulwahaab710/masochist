As far as I can tell, the best way to do this (for example, when you want to test Retina visuals on a machine that doesn't have a Retina display, like a MacBook Air), you can use Firefox, go to `about:config`, and change `layout.css.devPixelsPerPx` from -1 to 2.

You can also do it in Chrome, but it is fiddlier:

# Zoom to 200%
# At the bottom of the JS console (`Option-Command-J`), click on "Emulation"
# Check the "Emulate screen" box
# Set "Device pixel ratio" to 2
# Make sure "Emulate viewport" is unchecked (otherwise the content gets resized)
# Uncheck "Shrink to fit" (it doesn't seem to do anything useful)
# Uncheck "Enable text autosizing"
