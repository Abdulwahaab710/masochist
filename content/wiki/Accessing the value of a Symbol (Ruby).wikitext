= Short version =

<pre>eval(:symbol_name.id2name)</pre>

Is the same as:

<pre>symbol_name</pre>

= Longer demo =

<pre>irb(main):001:0> a = "this is a String object"
=> "this is a String object"
irb(main):002:0> :a
=> :a
irb(main):003:0> :a.id2name
=> "a"
irb(main):004:0> eval(:a.id2name)
=> "this is a String object"
irb(main):005:0> b = eval(:a.id2name)
=> "this is a String object"
irb(main):006:0> a.object_id == b.object_id
=> true</pre>
