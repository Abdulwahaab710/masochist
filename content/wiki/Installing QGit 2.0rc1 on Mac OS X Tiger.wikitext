These notes were made while installing [[QGit]] for the first time on [[Mac OS X]] [[Tiger]]. As this was the first time I had built a [[Qt]]-based [[app]] on [[Mac OS X]] I had to first download and build the Qt frameworks.

<pre># download latest version of Qt
# http://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/mac
wget http://wftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/Qt/qt/source/qt-mac-opensource-src-4.3.0.tar.gz

# extract
tar xzvf qt-mac-opensource-src-4.3.0.tar.gz 
cd qt-mac-opensource-src-4.3.0/

# build
./configure
make
sudo make install

# download QGit
cd ..
wget "http://dfn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/qgit/qgit-2.0rc1.tar.bz2"

# extract
tar xjvf qgit-2.0rc1.tar.bz2 
cd qgit

# ensure that qmake is in path
export PATH="/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.3.0/bin/:$PATH"

# build
qmake qgit.pro 
make

# test built application
open bin/qgit.app

# install (into $HOME/bin/)
sudo make install</pre>
