From the official announcement to the [Git mailing list](/wiki/Git_mailing_list):

    The latest maintenance release Git 1.7.2.3 is available at the
    usual places:

     http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/

     git-1.7.2.3.tar.{gz,bz2}			(source tarball)
     git-htmldocs-1.7.2.3.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)
     git-manpages-1.7.2.3.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)

    The RPM binary packages for a few architectures are found in:

     RPMS/$arch/git-*-1.7.2.3-1.fc11.$arch.rpm	(RPM)

    We will soon be preparing for 1.7.3 feature release but during the
    pre-release freeze period for it, I expect one more maintenance updates
    to the 1.7.2.X series.

    Thanks everybody who contributed to this release to help making git less
    suck ;-)


    Git v1.7.2.3 Release Notes
    ==========================

    Fixes since v1.7.2.2
    --------------------

    * When people try insane things such as delta-compressing 4GiB files, we
      threw an assertion failure.

    * "git archive" gave the full commit ID for "$Format:%h$".

    * "git fetch --tags" did not fetch tags when remote.<nick>.tagopt was set
      to --no-tags.  The command line option now overrides the configuration
      setting.

    * "git for-each-ref --format='%(objectname:short)'" has been completely
      broken for a long time.

    * "git gc" incorrectly pruned a rerere record that was created long
      time ago but still is actively and repeatedly used.

    * "git log --follow -M -p" was seriously broken in 1.7.2, reporting
      assertion failure.

    * Running "git log" with an incorrect option started pager nevertheless,
      forcing the user to dismiss it.

    * "git rebase" did not work well when the user has diff.renames
      configuration variable set.

    * An earlier (and rather old) fix to "git rebase" against a rebased
      upstream broke a more normal, non rebased upstream case rather badly,
      attempting to re-apply patches that are already accepted upstream.

    * "git submodule sync" forgot to update the superproject's config file
      when submodule URL changed.

    * "git pack-refs --all --prune" did not remove a directory that has
      become empty.
