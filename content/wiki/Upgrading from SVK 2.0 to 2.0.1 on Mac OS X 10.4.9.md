The basic recipe for upgrading using [CPAN](/wiki/CPAN) is:

    sudo -H perl -MCPAN -e 'install SVK'

Or if you have a sufficiently up-to-date copy of the [CPAN](/wiki/CPAN) module (which installs the `cpan` command-line tool):

    sudo -H cpan SVK

The first time I tried to update I got an "already up-to-date" message. It seems I need to look for better mirrors. I did a `sudo -H cpan` and entered `o conf init` so as to pick some different mirrors, and then finally `install SVK` worked.
