= Gotchas =

* `*` is special when not escaped but...
* `+` is special when escaped
* `\{x,y}` (escaping only the opening bracket) works but...
* You have to use `\( \)` (escape both parens)
* `[]` is special when both are unescaped

= Pro-Tips =

* `\v`: everything is special unless escaped ("very magic")
* `\V`: turn off very-magic
* You can use (somewhat) arbitrary delimiters, like `@`, instead of `/`
* `\_`: match anything, including newlines (cf: `.`)
* `\zs`: match but don't capture; useful for partial substitutions:
** `:%s/foo\zsbar/baz/g` will change "foobar" to "foobaz"
** `:%s/\v^(foobar)(baz)/\1/` (same with explicit capturing and restoration)
** `:%s/\v(^foobar)@<=baz//` (same with zero-width look-behind assertion)
* `\=`: evaluate an expression on right side of regex; eg: `:%s/\v(\S+)/\=expand(submatch(1))/g` (turns `~/foo` into full path)

= Making Vim regexen more sane =

Always be "very magic" with this in your `~/.vimrc`:

 nnoremap / /\v
 vnoremap / /\v

= Using Ruby to do heavy lifting instead =

`:rubydo` can be used to transform lines; eg:

 :rubydo $_ = $_.split(' ').reverse.join(' <- ')
