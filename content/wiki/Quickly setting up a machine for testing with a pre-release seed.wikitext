= Set-up =

When working on a pre-release seed I try not to customize the environment too much because I may have to uninstall and reinstall many times. But there are some changes that I find that I just can't live without. Here is a quick list.

Assuming that the home directory of my production (non-pre-release) system is mounted at <tt>/Volumes/path_to_home_folder</tt>:

<pre>RESOURCES=/Volumes/path_to_home_folder
cd
cp $RESOURCES/.bash_profile .
cp $RESOURCES/.inputrc .
cp $RESOURCES/.profile .
mkdir .ssh
cp $RESOURCES/.ssh/id_dsa .ssh
cp $RESOURCES/.ssh/id_dsa_subversion .ssh
cp $RESOURCES/.ssh/config .ssh
mkdir .subversion
cp $RESOURCES/.subversion/config .subversion
mkdir .MacOSX
defaults write ~/.MacOSX/environment SVN_SSH -string "/usr/bin/ssh -i /Users/wincent/.ssh/id_dsa_subversion"
mkdir bin</pre>

Copy my SSH management application into <tt>bin</tt> and double-click it while holding down the option key. In the preferences window, add the <tt>id_dsa</tt> and <tt>id_dsa_subversion</tt> identities and set the app to launch at login. Log out and log in again so that the environment variable settings can take effect.

I also find it pretty frusting to use the Terminal unless Option-Left and Option-Right are bound to <tt>\033b</tt> and <tt>\033f</tt> respectively; so pick up my settings like so:

<pre>cp $RESOURCES/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist Library/Preferences/</pre>
