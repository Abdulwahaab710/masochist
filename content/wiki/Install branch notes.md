There are no plans to branch [Install](/wiki/Install) because of its nature as a deployment tool it must run on as many versions of [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X) as possible. It was first released when [Jaguar](/wiki/Jaguar) was the current version of the operating system and the intention is to maintain compatibility with all versions from [Jaguar](/wiki/Jaguar) and up.

Even short-lived feature branches are unlikely to be used (see "[Branching](/wiki/Branching)") because stability of the code is paramount and the feature set is already complete for most purposes.
