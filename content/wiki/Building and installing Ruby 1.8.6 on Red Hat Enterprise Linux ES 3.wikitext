These notes were made during the upgrade from [[Ruby 1.8.5]] to [[Ruby 1.8.6]] on my [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES 3]] box.

= Build =

<pre>wget ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.6.tar.bz2
openssl md5 ruby-1.8.6.tar.bz2
tar xjf ruby-1.8.6.tar.bz2
cd ruby-1.8.6
./configure --enable-install-doc
make
make test
sudo make install
make check</pre>

= Failed tests =

Two tests fail identically (and harmlessly) as they did for [[Ruby 1.8.4]] and [[Ruby 1.8.5]] (see "[[Building and installing Ruby 1.8.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES 3]]" and "[[Building and installing Ruby 1.8.5 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES 3]]").
