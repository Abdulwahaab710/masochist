[http://blog.grayproductions.net/articles/dsl_block_styles This article] provides an excellent overview of the two main DSL "block styles" available in Ruby:

Either, redefining `self` and using `instance_eval`:

<pre lang="ruby">adapter.config do
  height 700
  width 500
end</pre>

Or, passing in a "configurator" object:

<pre lang="ruby">adapter config do |c|
  c.height 700
  c.width 500
end</pre>

The advantage of the former is the clean syntax, but the disadvantage is that by changing `self` you might break message sends that rely on an implicit (and different) `self` value; eg:

<pre lang="ruby">def width_helper
  # complicated calculation...
end

adapter.config do
  height 700
  width width_helper # NoMethodError raised here
end</pre>

A third style not mentioned in the article is to use subclasses:

<pre lang="ruby">class MyConfig < Config
  def config
    height 700 # height method defined in Config superclass
    width 500 # width method defined in Config superclass
  end
end</pre>
