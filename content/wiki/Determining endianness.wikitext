I just had cause to remove some code from a project I was working on; where previously I had to detect endianness I now no longer need to. But the code snippet may be useful in the future so I am pasting it in here:

<pre>BOOL is_little_endian(void)
{
#if defined(__LITTLE_ENDIAN__)
    return YES;
#elif defined(__BIG_ENDIAN__)
    return NO;
#else
    // try to figure out endianness dynamically
    int i = 0;
    ((char *)(&i))[0] = 1;
    return (i == 1);
#endif
}</pre>

This isn't the exact code I used, but it demonstrates the idea.
