```shell
$ history -d 23
```

Alas, I haven't found an equivalent of this for [Zsh](/wiki/Zsh), short of editing the `~/.history` file by hand.

That's the case for "after the fact" deletion. To prevent something from being added to the history in the first place you can prefix the command with a space.
