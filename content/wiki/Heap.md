# Operations

## Core operations

-   insert O(log n)
-   extract O(log n)
    -   extract min (for a min heap)
    -   extract max (for a max heap)

## Other operations

-   heapify (ie. batch insert) O(n)
-   delete O(log n)

# Example applications

-   Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm: O(m log n)
-   Heapsort: O(n log n)

In general, any algorithm that requires a priority queue.
