As of [commit 78e9ef2ff7](https://github.com/wincent/wincent/commit/78e9ef2ff714b96c62a81f0b44319af57bc93a9f) in my dotfiles, I do this with the `|` binding, and at the prompt enter something like `cat > ~/Desktop/message.txt`.

In [commit 38cbf10272](https://github.com/wincent/wincent/commit/38cbf1027218a069a8bec960165d4380456ce3ce) I added an "O" macro for this because I have trouble remembering the above.
