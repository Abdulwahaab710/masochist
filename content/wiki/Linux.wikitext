[[Linux]] is a popular [[open source]]Â operating system kernel. The term "[[Linux]]" is often used to refer to the entire operating system, not just the kernel, although strictly speaking the term [[GNU/Linux]] would be more appropriate given that the vast bulk of the operating system comprises [[GNU]] software.
