= The new way =

As noted in [/comments/7325 this comment below], the way originally documented in this article no longer applies.

You now need a clone of the separate "git-manpages" repo at the same level as your "git.git" clone. For an example showing how the install works in this case, see "[[Installing Git 1.7.10 on CentOS 5.7]]".

= The old way =

I learnt some time ago via [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/116538 this mailing list post] that there is a [[make]] target that will install the pre-built man pages that are stored in "man" and "html" branches of the official [[Git]] repository.

<pre lang="ruby">$ cd path/to/your/clone/of/the/official/git.git/repo
$ make quick-install-man
$ make quick-install-html</pre>

This is ''considerably'' easier than building the documentation yourself.

'''Note:''' This only works from inside a clone of the "git.git" repository, because it works by grabbing the docs from the other branches in the repository. It won't work if run from inside a downloaded tarball of the source tree.
