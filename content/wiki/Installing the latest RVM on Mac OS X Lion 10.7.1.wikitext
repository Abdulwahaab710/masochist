Follow the instructions from https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/:

<pre lang="shell">$ bash < <(curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm)</pre>

In my `.bash_profile` I have:

<pre lang="bash">if [[ -s $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm ]]; then
  source $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm
else
  # make Bundler do passwordless installs to a sandbox rather than to the system
  export BUNDLE_PATH=~/.bundle
fi</pre>

The goal here is that when [[RVM]] is available, we use that, and when it isn't we tell Bundler to install into a shared area inside my home directory. That way I never have to do gem installations with root privileges.

Upon re-sourcing the `.bash_profile` you can do:

<pre lang="shell">$ rvm list known
$ rvm install 1.8.7
$ which ruby
$ rvm use 1.8.7
$ which ruby</pre>
