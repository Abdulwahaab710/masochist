These notes were made while upgrading from [[RSpec 1.0.0]] to [[RSpec 1.0.2]] on [[Mac OS X]] [[Tiger]] (I skipped over [[RSpec 1.0.1]] because the 1.0.2 release came out before I had time to install it).

At the same time I upgraded to [[Spec::UI 0.2.3]]; see "[[Upgrading to Spec::UI 0.2.3 on Mac OS X Tiger]]".

I used the same installation procedure that I employed when upgrading to [[RSpec 1.0.0]] (see "[[Upgrading to RSpec 1.0.0 on Mac OS X Tiger]]").

= Pre-testing =

First double check that all [[specs]] are passing for [[Walrus]]. This is a good check because there are a ''lot'' of specifications, many of them containing numerous assertions:

<pre># from the top-level directory of the Walrus source tree:
rake spec</pre>

= Download and install =

<pre>sudo gem install rspec</pre>

== Output ==

<pre>Successfully installed rspec-1.0.2
Installing ri documentation for rspec-1.0.2...
Installing RDoc documentation for rspec-1.0.2...</pre>

= Update [[FastRI]] index =

<pre>fastri-server -b</pre>

== Output ==

= Post-testing =

<pre># run the specs again
rake spec</pre>

= [[TextMate]] =

<pre>cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/RSpec.tmbundle
svn up</pre>

== Output ==

There were no changes since the last [[RSpec]] release, so I wonder why they bother releasing a new version of the [[TextMate]] bundle (see http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=797):

<pre>At revision 2011.</pre>

== After updating ==

Normally, if [[TextMate]] is running, from the [[TextMate]] "Bundles" menu, open the "Bundle Editor" submenu and select "Reload Bundles". But in this case as there were no changes this should not be necessary.

= [[Rails]] =

I have a [[Rails]] project where [[rspec]] is installed as a plug-in. The <tt>--force</tt> switch is necessary in order to install over the previously installed copy:

<pre># from inside the Rails application top-level directory
script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_1_0_2/rspec
script/plugin install --force svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rspec/tags/REL_1_0_2/rspec_on_rails</pre>

See if any other changes are necessary:

<pre>script/generate rspec --pretend</pre>

== Output ==

<pre>      exists  spec
   identical  spec/spec_helper.rb
overwrite spec/spec.opts? [Ynaqd] n
        skip  spec/spec.opts
   identical  previous_failures.txt
   identical  script/spec_server
   identical  script/spec</pre>

Seeing as I am using [[version control]] and can revert painlessly, I decided to go ahead and see if there were any significant changes to the <tt>spec.opts</tt> file:

<pre>$ script/generate rspec
      exists  spec
   identical  spec/spec_helper.rb
overwrite spec/spec.opts? [Ynaqd] Y
       force  spec/spec.opts
   identical  previous_failures.txt
   identical  script/spec_server
   identical  script/spec
$ svk diff spec
=== spec/spec.opts

$ svk revert spec/spec.opts
Reverted spec/spec.opts</pre>

As you can see, there were no significant changes to the file, so I revert it to preserve the customizations that I had previously made (see "[[Using autotest with Rails]]").
