[[Modular scale]] is the application of historically/culturally pleasing ratios to type and layout. For example, we can take a base value (like 14px) and scale it upwards and downwards in steps of 1.618 (the golden ratio), or some other ratio such as a musical interval.

We can superimpose another scale (using a different base value and ratio) to produce a "double-stranded" scale.
